Chinese scientists develop cure for diabetes, insulin patient becomes medicine-free in just 3 months [Healthcare]
In a significant medical milestone, Chinese scientists have successfully cured a patient's diabetes using a groundbreaking cell therapy.
This pioneering treatment was developed by a team from Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, the Centre for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Renji Hospital, and was detailed in the journal Cell Discovery on April 30.
Patient's Journey to RecoveryAccording to a South China Morning Post report, the patient underwent the cell transplant in July 2021.
Remarkably, within eleven weeks, he no longer required external insulin.
Over the next year, he gradually reduced and ultimately stopped taking oral medication for blood sugar control.
"Follow-up examinations showed that the patient's pancreatic islet function was effectively restored," said Yin, one of the lead researchers.
The patient has now been insulin-free for 33 months.
This breakthrough marks a significant advancement in cell therapy for diabetes.
Timothy Kieffer, a professor at the University of British Columbia, praised the study, saying, "I think this study represents an important advance in the field of cell therapy for diabetes."
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the body's ability to convert food into energy, leading to severe complications if not managed properly.
Traditional treatments involve insulin injections and constant monitoring, which can be burdensome for patients.
Innovative Approach to Cell TherapyThe new therapy involves programming the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells, transforming them into "seed cells" to recreate pancreatic islet tissue in an artificial environment.
This approach leverages the body's regenerative capabilities, an emerging field known as regenerative medicine.
"Our technology has matured and it has pushed boundaries in the field of regenerative medicine for the treatment of diabetes," Yin stated.
Implications for China's Healthcare SystemChina, with the highest number of diabetes patients globally, faces a substantial healthcare burden.
According to the International Diabetes Federation, 140 million people in China have diabetes, with 40 million relying on lifelong insulin injections.
This new cell therapy could significantly reduce this burden.
Kieffer noted that if this cell therapy approach proves effective in larger studies, "it can free patients from the burden of chronic medications, improve health and quality of life, and reduce healthcare expenditures."
However, he emphasized the necessity of further studies involving more patients to validate these promising findings.

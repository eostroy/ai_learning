China: Drugmakers rely on supplies using Uyghur forced labor: report
: The global pharmaceutical industry relies on ingredients made in China's far-western Xinjiang region using Uyghur forced labor despite efforts to eliminate this risk from supply chains, according to a new report.
The report by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, or C4ADS, says that even two U.S. government agencies - the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Agency for International Development via its contractor Chemonics International - have not cut ties with Xinjiang-linked drug suppliers.
This is happening despite U.S. laws that require American companies to ensure there is no forced labor in their supply chains.
Our findings indicate that international governments remain tied to the Uyghur region, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, Mishel Kondi, author of the report, told Radio Free Asia.
The use of Uyghur forced labor is one of the repressive measures the Chinese Communist Party has taken in Xinjiang, where about 12 million Uyghurs live, and it is deeply entrenched in the region's economy, the report says.
The Chinese companies mentioned in the report contribute to the oppression of the mostly Muslim ethnic group by benefiting from land that's seized from Uyghurs and made available for corporate use, and from relying on forced labor by Uyghurs and Kazakhs laborers.
Also, Uyghurs detained in internment camps have been forced into drug testing and medical procedures, the report says.
Human guinea pigs
This is borne out by accounts from Uyghurs who have left China.
Qelbinur Sidik, who was forced to teach Chinese in separate detention facilities for Uyghur men and women, and former camp detainee Mihrigul Tursun both told RFA about authorities forcing girls and women to take pills that caused them to stop menstruating and nursing mothers' breast milk to dry up.
Nearly 90% of women in this camp were aged 18 to 40 years old. All of these women's menstruation ended after taking these pills and injections, Sidik said. Even the milk of the nursing mothers was depleted.
Uyghur men had to take tablets or were given injections and later had blood drawn, Sidik added.
I am confident that the Chinese government used the detained Uyghurs for experiments to test their medicines, she said.
Tursun said the small white tablets she had to take gave her severe stomach pains and chills, and made her feel weak and drowsy. They also made her period stop for six months.
I was given medicines once a week. I don't know what medicines they were, she said. They called your number from a book. When they called your number, you opened your mouth. They gave me small white tablets. They checked our mouths to make sure we swallowed them.
Tursun said she then developed a bad stomach ache. My whole body became weakened and drowsy, my head spun, and my legs shivered. It lasted 2-3 days.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.
Acetaminophen granules, estrogen cream
Though Xinjiang is a minor player in the pharma production industry in China - the world's largest active pharmaceutical ingredient producer and the second-largest drug market in the world - there are 43 licensed pharma companies in the region.
Among the 661 products they manufacture are acetaminophen granules, estrogen tablets and cream, and traditional Chinese and Uyghur medicine. Seventy-six pharma products exported from China are manufactured only in Xinjiang, exposing global supply chains to forced labor, the report says.
Eleven of the manufacturers are Chinese state-owned enterprises, 21 are owned by private individuals, nine are owned by companies with a known record of forced labor in other industries, and two are tied to Chinese defense contractors.
None of the manufacturers appear on the Entity List under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, or UFLPA, the report says.
And foreign companies - including Citigroup and BlackRock - continue to hold shares in some of them, it says.
But implementation of the UFLPA remains weak, the report says.
Supply chains and corporate structures are often opaque; enforcement agencies lack sufficient resources to track, monitor, and enforce regulations, and the diverse agencies responsible for implementing them are still in the process of translating how to most effectively do so, it says.
Despite the UFLPA's rebuttable presumption - which assumes goods made in Xinjiang are produced with forced labor and thus banned under the U.S. 1930 Tariff Act - only one pharma producer from Xinjiang - Chenguang Biotech Group Co., Ltd. - has been added to the Entity List, the report notes.
Chemonics International
As recently as 2019, USAID contractor Chemonics International, based in Washington, purchased products from the Xinjiang Tianneng Chemical Ltd. Co., the report says, citing data from the 2023 Global Health Supply Chain Program Procurement and Supply Management Project.
Tianneng Chemical is owned by a subsidiary of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, or XPCC, a state-owned enterprise and paramilitary organization operating in Xinjiang that has been added to the Entity List for perpetrating human rights abuses.
Through this procurement, Chemonics International appears to have unknowingly financially supported (through trade) a company owned by a subsidiary of a paramilitary entity and perpetrator of human rights abuses, the report says.
In response to C4ADS' information, Chemonics said it had not ordered any other products directly or indirectly from Tianneng Chemical and did not plan to do so.
A USAID spokesperson told RFA that the agency prioritizes preventing the use of U.S. government funds for contract awards to companies that may use forced labor, and its partners are required to comply with legal requirements prohibiting the use of forced labor under federal acquisition regulations.
Chemonics confirmed to USAID that it has not purchased any products from Tianneng Chemical outside of one transaction in 2019, prior to the date the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions, and said it has taken steps to avoid procurements from the manufacturer in the future, according to the spokesperson.
The report also says that the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has registered at least two Xinjiang-linked pharmaceutical producers, authorizing them to import to the United States, though the companies should be on the UFLPA Entity List.
A FDA spokesperson said the agency would be in touch when it had information to share.
The report said Japan's Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency registered four Xinjiang-based entities involved in biotech and pharma that conflicted with efforts to address human rights abuses in the region.
Specifically, Japan issued guidelines in 2022 urging businesses established there to monitor for human rights in their supply chains. The following year, the country's parliament passed a resolution expressing concern about the treatment of Uyghurs and other human rights abuses in China.
Mexico and Canada have forced labor legislation in place, while the European Union this year passed a forced labor ban that will take effect in 2027.
Case studies
The 44-page report issued on Oct. 8 includes four case studies of companies that C4ADS says should be excluded from supply chains because of their ties to human rights abuses that have been overlooked by enforcement.
Sinopharm National Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., a partially state-owned company, participated in Chinese Communist Party-led work teams believed to be main components of poverty alleviation programs that subject rural Uyghurs to forced assimilation and forced labor, the report says.
Xinjiang Deyuan Bioengineering Co. Ltd., a top manufacturer of drugs derived from human plasma operating exclusively in Xinjiang, appears to have directly benefited from forced displacement and government subsidies, it says.
Unfortunately, we were unable to find smoking-gun evidence that the blood collected by Xinjiang Deyuan Bioengineering comes from people detained in camps, Kondi said.
While the company claims that blood donations are voluntary, we could not confirm or refute this. However, given the human rights abuses in the region, this remains a serious red flag for businesses involved with these entities.
Another company, Xinjiang Nuziline Bio-Pharmaceutical Co., which manufactures conjugated estrogen, also relies on Uyghur laborers, while Xinjiang Huashidan Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., a maker of Western and traditional Chinese and Uyghur herbal medicine, appears to have benefited from the displacement of the local population, the report says.
The report is based on production license data, corporate records, and trade data - all publicly available information - and local media reports.
Recommendations
C4ADS recommends that all U.S. federal agencies conduct assessments of their procurement practices' compliance with anti-forced labor sanctions regimes.
The U.S. government, meanwhile, should increase resources for - and improve interagency cooperation - for better monitoring and enforcement of sanctions, the report says.
It further recommends that the U.S. government strengthen its existing trade agreements by improving multilateral coordination on monitoring Chinese imports and bilateral and multilateral monitoring by sharing intelligence with other countries that import pharmaceuticals from China.
Governments should turn the ongoing conversations about combating Uyghur forced labor into actionable legal precedents, Kondi said.
C4ADS has produced other reports on human rights abuses in Xinjiang. In August 2021, it published the findings of an investigation into how the global economy supports oppression in Xinjiang. In 2022, it issued reports on Xinjiang goods entering global supply chains and the Chinese government's industrial transfer into the region.

Indian medicine wows Chinese diplomat: Soar throat, neck pain gone at minimum cost [People]
: India's healthcare system has long been recognized for delivering high-quality care at low costs, and it recently received an unexpected endorsement from a prominent figure. Yu Jing, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in India, publicly praised Indian medicines for effectively treating her sore throat and neck pain, sparking significant online discussion and even some diplomatic speculation. Chinese Embassy Spokesperson Lauds Indian Medicine In a post shared on X (formerly Twitter), Yu Jing expressed her gratitude, stating, "Sincerely praise the Indian medicine, which cured my sore throat and neck pain effectively. Good quality at a fair price. Incredible!" Her message quickly gained traction, accumulating over 500,000 views and drawing numerous responses from users who echoed her sentiments about the effectiveness and affordability of Indian healthcare solutions. Social Media Reactions One user highlighted the accessibility of healthcare in India, particularly noting how it often goes underappreciated despite challenges such as a low doctor-to-population ratio. "The ease of accessibility in the Indian healthcare system is something we don't hype enough," they commented, while another user added, "Indian medicine never fails to impress! Truly grateful!" Suggestions for traditional remedies also surfaced, with one user recommending, "You can try some Ayurvedic medicine or drink kadha, a combination of turmeric, tulsi leaves, black pepper, ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, and honey, mixed in warm water." Diplomatic Implications: A Softening Stance? Interestingly, Yu Jing's comment comes at a time of cautious diplomatic maneuvering between India and China, following a prolonged and tense standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) since 2020. The ongoing border tensions, marked by violent clashes including the deadly Galwan Valley incident, have led both nations to tread carefully in their diplomatic engagements. Recent signs of reconciliation have emerged, with India approving some Chinese investments that had been on hold and both sides agreeing to "narrow down the differences" in their relationship. Given this backdrop, Yu Jing's public praise of Indian medicine has led to speculation that it might signal a subtle shift in Beijing's approach towards India. Some observers believe that this could be an indication of China's willingness to ease tensions as both countries explore paths to de-escalation. The timing of the comment is particularly intriguing, as it coincides with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's confirmation to attend the upcoming BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, in October. This summit could provide a potential platform for Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping to engage in further diplomatic talks, possibly paving the way for a resolution to the ongoing LAC standoff. India Growing Healthcare Influence In a related story, Mackenzie, an American vlogger known for her channel UNSTUK with Mac & Keen, also praised the Indian healthcare system. She shared her experience of how her British boyfriend, Keenan, fell ill during their trip to India. Initially concerned about finding timely and affordable medical care, she was amazed by the efficiency and low cost of the services they received. Lab tests were conducted conveniently at their location, with results delivered the same day, all for just $ 14 (approximately Rs 1,100). "I'm blown away, this is incredible," she remarked, emphasizing the value of India's healthcare.

Chinese farmers across 14 towns are spraying industrial sulfur on wolfberries so they'll be 'red and beautiful': state media
: Loh, Matthew. 
: - Wolfberry farmers in China were caught smoking their crops with industrial sulfur to preserve them.
- Chinese state media also aired clips of workers washing the berries in thick, foaming chemicals.
- Merchants and workers told the broadcaster they knew the berries were unsafe, but they looked better.
The Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has unveiled details of a second major food scandal to rock the country this year, this time involving wolfberries smoked and soaked in prohibited chemicals.
In a report aired on Sunday, the broadcaster spoke to wolfberry farmers and merchants in a region spanning 14 towns in Jingyuan County, Gansu Province. The report also covered farms in Golmud, a city in Qinghai Province.
At least half a dozen farm workers and dealers openly described on camera how farms would soak the berries in sodium metabisulfite, a banned substance in the industry, and spray them with industrial sulfur to preserve their appearance.
"The ones smoked with sulfur are red and beautiful," one store owner told the broadcaster. "With the sulfur, you can store it longer, and pests don't grow. Its toxicity is high."
CCTV aired footage of farm workers preparing vats of thick, foaming sodium metabisulfite before washing the wolfberries in the hazardous chemical. Sodium metabisulfite is sometimes used in food preservation but is prohibited in the local wolfberry industry, state media reported.
Clips published by CCTV showed that some farms would also add in the step of smoking the wolfberries with industrial sulfur in place of sun-drying their crop.
Wolfberries, also known as goji berries, are popular in Chinese traditional medicine and dishes such as hotpot and were marketed as a superfood in the West. In 2023, mainland China exported an estimated 14,000 metric tons of wolfberries.
"People like you who sell in other places all have no idea," one merchant told CCTV. "It just has a nice appearance."
Many of the merchants and farmers spoke of the harms of consuming wolfberries tainted by the chemicals but said the practice was common.
"With sulfur, you sell at 17 yuan to 18 yuan per catty. Without smoking, it's 10 yuan per catty, 9 yuan per catty. That's not a good price," one rural farm worker said.
CCTV said its staff tested the wolfberries and found them all unsafe for consumption.
A day after the report was released, the Jingyuan County Food Safety Committee office announced it had launched an investigation into local wolfberry production and sales.
"Those responsible for violations of the law and regulations will be severely punished according to the law," the office said in a statement.
The Golmud city government released a similar statement on Monday.
The wolfberry scandal has come just two months after another major food-related safety incident stunned the country.
In early July, the state outlet Beijing News said it had uncovered multiple instances of unwashed chemical tankers being used to transport cooking oil. The practice had become so common that workers spoke of it as an industry standard, the outlet reported.
China has been plagued for decades by food scandals — such as contaminated milk powder and gutter oil being reused in restaurants — that have whittled away domestic consumer faith in commercially sold foods.
Since his early days as China's top leader, Xi Jinping has promised to crack down on food safety breaches, saying they're central to how people perceive the government.
"If our party, while governing China, cannot even ensure food safety, and cannot do so over the long term, then people will start to question whether we are qualified to govern," he said in 2013.
Allegations of excessive sulfur fumigation in the Chinese traditional-medicine industry have surfaced before, leading retailers to often sell wolfberries and other products as "sulfite-free."

A rare look at the lousy life aboard China's 'Dragon Palace' submarines
: Peck, Michael. 
: - A new report offers a rare look at the conditions in China's growing submarine fleet.
- It found the crews suffer from excessive noise, poor lighting and bad air quality.
- The question is whether these problems undermine the effectiveness of China's subs.
Chinese sailors have an ironic name for duty aboard submarines: "Dragon Palace." But there is nothing fantastic — or even healthy — about the conditions in China's large submarine force, a new report has found.
Chinese "submariners have long jokingly referred to their boats as the 'dragon palace' in reference to the palace of the dragon king at the bottom of the Eastern Sea in Chinese mythology," explained a new report by the US Naval War College's China Maritime Studies Institute.
In Chinese mythology, Ao Guang is the king of all sea dragons, ruling over them from his underwater crystal palace. But life aboard People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) submarines is far from palatial, the CMSI report found, offering a rare look at submarine life that is obscured by the Chinese military's secrecy and the regime's widespread censorship and intimidation. It found the crews suffer from excessive noise, poor lighting and bad air quality. The canned foods often served are so tasteless some sailors develop eating disorders.
"Work aboard PLAN submarines can cost personnel their health," said the CMSI report. For example, various surveys over the last two decades found numerous maladies, including mouth ulcers and back pain. "In 2018, researchers from several PLAN institutes and hospitals conducting surveys at a submarine base found that submariners as a profession were prone to lower back pain due to restrictive workspaces, long hours in fixed or contorted positions, and the constant vibration to which they are subjected. Results showed a 33.81%occurrence of lower back pain in commissioned officers and enlisted personnel."
Crews suffer psychological effects from the constant noise and low air quality they're subjected to underway. "Crew members working and living in a submarine's poor microclimate are prone to boredom, fatigue, lethargy, and discomfort, which impacts their psychological state, cognitive abilities, and emotional well-being," the report said. "These problems are further exacerbated by harmful gases, magnetic fields, noise, vibrations, and many other barriers to restful sleep and comfort."
Noise levels aboard Chinese have been measured as high as 90 to 130 decibels, which exceeds even the Chinese military's threshold of 85 to 100 decibels. Sub crews have also reported eyesight problems that stem from the poor quality lighting. "Analysis attributed this to poor lighting causing visual strain and close quarters, causing a problem in the ciliary muscles that regulate changes in eye lens curvature," CMSI said. "Crews requested more lighting in compartments and lighting modes that could provide an indication of day or night."
Meanwhile, medical care during long-duration voyages is lacking due to poorly trained caregivers and unkept medical equipment, the report found.
That may be why China's sub force recently turned to traditional Chinese medicine, already used by other branches of the Chinese military. "Until recently, Chinese traditional medicine was not present on board PLAN submarines, since there were no designated positions to administer it," said CMSI.
Sailors in most navies grumble about food. Even US Navy subs, which reputedly have better chow than other ships, have their share of grousing about penal-quality meals. Providing appetizing food for months at a time is a challenge on Chinese subs, whose crews vary from around 60 on a diesel-powered attack boat to around 120 on a ballistic missile submarine.
Though some recent photos suggest an appealing menu, Chinese submarine cuisine still appears to be lacking. "Since submarines prohibit open flame cooking, canned food appears to have been the staple for many years on long-distance deployments," said CMSI. After "the poor taste of canned food eventually drove some sailors to become anorexic," more fresh and frozen food was served. But when "the fresh food runs out or electricity conservation is enacted, submarine crews reportedly begin eating standard field rations, such as the navy's KT-07 nutritional supplement rations. To make up for these conditions, submariners can usually expect a feast to welcome them when returning to shore."
Ultimately, the question is whether these problems undermine the effectiveness of China's 61 submarines. Though most are conventional rather than nuclear-powered, they could be among Beijing's most effective weapons if China were to invade Taiwan.
"Many of the hallmarks of a professional submarine force culture are present aboard PLAN submarines, especially surrounding secrecy, safety, and expertise," CMSI concluded. "Whether it is procedures for equipment maintenance or nuclear reactor safety, the force appears to demonstrate a high level of professionalism and a desire to uphold the highest standards across the fleet."
Chinese submariners have their own "dragon palace culture." This includes activities such as arm wrestling and ping pong contests, as well as other morale-boosters such as shipboard newsletters and poetry readings.
And what submarine force would be complete without its special rituals (that often baffle landlubbers). For example, a ceremony to honor those doing their first long-duration deployments happens when the submarine reaches maximum dive depth, the report said. "Recognized personnel will kiss a buttered hammer and drink seawater drawn from the depths, which is kept within a vial."

AI turns doctor, detects diseases with 98% accuracy by analysing tongue colour as per Chinese medicine practice
: New Delhi, Aug. 18 -- Researchers from Iraq and Australia claim they've created an artificial intelligence (AI) computer algorithm capable of analysing tongue colour to diagnose medical conditions in real time, boasting 98% accuracy.
According to the study led by Ali Al-Naji, affiliated with universities in Baghdad and Australia, individuals with diabetes usually exhibit a yellow tongue while cancer patients often have a purple tongue with a thick coating. Those suffering from acute strokes tend to have an oddly shaped red tongue.
Al-Naji explained that certain tongue colours might reveal various health issues. The imaging system is inspired by a traditional Chinese practice of analysing the tongue to detect illnesses, he said.
"A white tongue can indicate anaemia; people with severe cases of COVID-19 are likely to have a deep-red tongue. An indigo- or violet-coloured tongue indicates vascular and gastrointestinal issues or asthma," the New York Post quoted Al-Naji as saying.
Researchers utilised over 5,200 images to train the AI model to recognise tongue colour and related health conditions. The model was tested using 60 tongue images from two hospitals in the Middle East.
During the tests, patients positioned themselves roughly 8 inches from a laptop's webcam, which captured a picture of their tongue. The program successfully identified the disease in nearly all instances.
Professor Javaan Chahl from the University of South Australia suggested that the technology could soon be integrated into a smartphone app to help diagnose various health issues like diabetes, stroke, anaemia, asthma and other conditions, the publication added.
He highlights that computerised tongue analysis offers a reliable, easy-to-use, cost-effective approach to screening diseases, combining modern technology with traditional practices.
As per WebMD, if someone notices a furry-looking coating on their tongue in black, brown or white, they could be dealing with a condition called "hairy" tongue. In this condition, proteins cause tiny bumps on the tongue to grow longer, trapping food and bacteria.
Brushing or scraping the tongue usually resolves it. However, if there are white patches that don't come off with scraping, it could indicate oral hairy leukoplakia, which may be linked to viral infections such as Epstein-Barr or HIV.

Methods to stop smoking naturally without medicines
: ALBAWABA Quitting smoking is a significant step towards better health and well-being. While medications and nicotine replacement therapies are common aids, many people prefer natural methods to kick the habit. Here are some effective strategies to help you stop smoking naturally:
1. Set a Quit Date and Make a Plan
- Choose a Date : Select a specific day to quit and mark it on your calendar.
- Plan Ahead : Identify potential challenges and plan how to overcome them. This can include avoiding triggers and preparing healthy distractions.
2. Find Your Motivation
- Personal Reasons : Write down the reasons you want to quit, such as improving your health, saving money, or protecting loved ones from secondhand smoke.
- Visual Reminders : Keep reminders of your motivations in places you frequent, such as on your fridge, phone, or car dashboard.
3. Stay Busy
- Hobbies and Activities : Engage in hobbies and activities that keep your hands and mind occupied.
- Exercise : Physical activity can reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It also improves mood and reduces stress.
4. Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques
- Deep Breathing : Practice deep breathing exercises to manage cravings and stress.
- Meditation and Yoga : These practices can help you stay calm and focused, reducing the urge to smoke.
5. Support System
- Talk to Friends and Family : Let your loved ones know you’re quitting so they can offer support and encouragement.
- Support Groups : Join a support group, either in person or online, to share experiences and gain motivation from others going through the same process.
6. Change Your Routine

7. Diet and Hydration
- Healthy Eating : Maintain a balanced diet to keep your body strong and resilient.
- Hydrate : Drink plenty of water to flush toxins from your system and reduce cravings.
8. Herbal Remedies
- Licorice Root : Chewing on licorice root can help reduce cravings due to its natural sweetness and oral fixation.
- Ginseng : Ginseng can help reduce the dopamine release associated with nicotine, making it easier to manage cravings.
- Lobelia : This herb is believed to help reduce the desire to smoke and improve mood.
9. Acupuncture and Acupressure
- Acupuncture : This traditional Chinese medicine technique involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the body to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms.
- Acupressure : Similar to acupuncture, but using pressure instead of needles, acupressure can be practiced at home to manage cravings.
10. Aromatherapy
- Essential Oils : Certain essential oils, like lavender and peppermint, can help reduce stress and curb cravings. Inhale directly or use a diffuser.
11. Positive Reinforcement
- Reward Yourself : Set up a reward system for milestones reached, such as being smoke-free for a day, a week, or a month.
- Track Progress : Keep a journal to document your journey, including the challenges faced and victories achieved.
12. Hypnotherapy

Stories from Hong Kong's secret garden: Chan Siun-kuen left rural China in the slipstream of the revolution for a rapidly urbanising city. His herb garden is a portal back to forgotten traditions and the healing power of plants. By Thomas Hale Hong Kong garden
: Hale, Thomas. 
: T here are several herb gardens in Hong Kong. There is one in the Botanical Gardens, close to the seat of government. There is another in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, an institution traceable in part to the revolution of 1949, when mainland scholars were scattered to the four winds. But the one that always caught my attention is tucked away, on one of the many paths winding through the Lung Fu Shan Country Park. With its abundant references to medicine, the garden at first glance seems like a portal into another era. In the English-speaking world, while herbs still adorn the kitchen shelf, their relationship with healing has taken on archaic associations. In China, where the very term is often expressed through the characters for "medicine" and "grass", several hundreds of herbs still play an important role in traditional healthcare practices. But few young people nowadays could name many of them, or would come across them. If gardens exist on a spectrum, this one is on the wilder end and, as though in concert with the forgetting of their names, the herbs have not always seemed in their best state. Last winter, to the extent that it occurs in Hong Kong, nettles had sprouted and the loose grass was trampled. The pots were weathered, and some had fallen over. Only a few flashes of purple — possibly thistles — broke up a jumble of stalks and leaves. Over four years of occasionally passing the garden, I had never before seen anyone tending to it. But this time there were two men, one middle-aged and one elderly, and at least a foot shorter. Many of the herbs had been stolen in the past few years, explained Alfred Ho, 54, the younger of the two. They were part of the walking group that had established the garden decades earlier. A small wooden stand on the premises displayed laminated cards of various herbs: firecracker vine, which is sweet and neutral; Chinese mesona, which is bland and cold; and white mugwort. There was artillery clearweed, goosegrass, four-o'clock, peppermint, xiao qing and sea cups. "Use only as prescribed by the physician," a sign said. The other gardener, who was born in 1934, did not speak a word of English, and his native Cantonese seemed to be rooted in the land itself. There was an unmistakable cheerfulness about him, as though he were in just the right place. Chan Siun-kuen, as it turns out, knows all about herbs. "I want more and more people to know [about them]," he later told me. Nicolette Perry, who has a PHD in pharmacognosy (the study of medicine from natural sources), runs the Dilston Physic Garden in Northumberland, which has around 700 medicinal plants. She recalls being "amazed" on a trip to Kenya last year; there were "five-year olds saying 'I'd take this tree and take this leaf and prepare it and drink it'". But of Dilston's estimated 2,000 visitors a year, "many are unaware of the traditional and modern uses" of herbs, she says, especially compared with other countries. The UK, which now displays herbs largely for ornamental or educational purposes, is just one example of a wider disconnection. It "used to have its own huge historical indigenous knowledge" of herbs, but this was "essentially lost" after the chemical revolution of the 19th century. "We've moved from rural to urban areas," she says. "That's also added to our lack of knowledge. We haven't been able to grow them [in quantity or variety] like we used to." Chan Siun-kuen had followed that trajectory himself, having moved to the urban metropolis of Hong Kong from rural southern China in 1949, when he was still a teenager. It wasn't until his forties, after 25 years working in a print manufacturing company, that he began to rediscover the countryside. In the 1970s, the territory's industrial boom, which later spread to mainland China, led to worsening pollution. Chan took up hiking in the hills, finding in his fellow walkers a shared enthusiasm for the area's plant life. He had also started to volunteer for the district council, helping with fire prevention. "At that time, many of the buildings were still made of wood," he recalls. The area in which he hiked, now full of well-marked trails leading up to Victoria Peak, was a different matter back then. The landscape was frequented by the triads, a set of powerful underground societies that operated outside of the law. They laid out furniture and offered breakfast, lunch, dinner and, for a fee, games of mah-jong. When the government wanted to establish a country park in the late 1990s, Chan, who had been hiking past them for years, became a middleman. "It was very complex," he says. He told the triads the government's new country park would be "for the people", and they "are not the enemy of the people". Eventually, they moved out. By now more and more people hiked in the morning: there was a group, the Morning Walkers' Association, of which Chan was appointed chair in 1999. Around a 10-minute walk from the mah-jong tables they planted a garden, with the assistance of the Hong Kong government and Hong Kong University, to promote herbs and Chinese medicine. They established "around 300 species", says Ning Wang, assistant professor in the School of Chinese Medicine, who was involved in the project about a decade ago. Today, labels feature Latin, English and Chinese descriptions. Cactus, for example, is written as "angel's palm", and is described as "bitter", "cold" and "moving qi and activating blood". The language draws on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, which is still widely used in pharmacies on the Continued on page 2 mainland. Many cards include the character qi, which Wang says is considered as "the foundation that builds our body" in Chinese medicine. For Chan, this was not new territory. "After I started the garden," he says, "IContinued from page 1 "I learnt about Chinese herbs again." As a young child, the hills Chan Siunkuen used to climb in Guangdong were different from those of Hong Kong. He used to go with his father, who previously worked as a bone-setting doctor, treating dislocations. But given food shortages caused by the Japanese invasions of the 1930s, he instead needed to work as a farmer. He would point out and collect herbs as they walked. There was a large herb shop in Guangzhou that he sometimes visited, Chan tells me. Traditional medicine, which goes back "thousands of years", is "closely related to Chinese history and Chinese culture", says Wang. Shennong, one of the mythological rulers of ancient China who is said to have taught humans the use of the plough, is the reputed author of one of the first texts documenting the A garden lost and a garden regained, and still Chan Siun-kuen cannot rest. Twice a week, with his friend Alfred Ho, he goes to the Lung Fu Shan herb garden. The herbs may keep getting uses and benefits of herbs. The 16thcentury naturalist and acupuncturist Li Shizhen categorised more than 1,000. At a public herb garden in Shanghai, there is a statue of Li . "Some people may be familiar with Chinese medicinal herbs, but they don't know their uses," says a 71-year-old woman, sitting on a bench outside the garden with her granddaughter and her friend. "Older people like us know about it." Mugwort, she explains, can be dried in the sun; dandelions reduce inflammation; leeks are also a form of medicine. "People of my generation learn from their elders," she adds. Anyway, when she was growing up in the countryside of the 1950s, she says, how could she and her siblings ever afford to see a western-style doctor? Chan's was an interrupted childhood. His father was killed by Japanese soldiers, who had seized Guangzhou in 1938. At the age of eight, with four siblings, he became a farmer himself. By his early teens, he could carry 100 jin, an amount equivalent to roughly 50kg. When the war ended, his mother took him to Hong Kong, where it was "easier to survive". He stayed on alone, though she eventually moved herself, decades later. There is one memory of the mainland that stays with him. One of the family's cows had fallen ill, and he recalled a herb to help in such situations. He used it, and it lived. His father had taught him, in the hills behind the village. "There were no cameras back then," he says. "But I still remember his face." stolen, which saddens him, but whoever it was at least saw a certain value in them, he says. There are fewer herb gardens of this kind now, Ho suspects. He says many of the group's members are getting old; they have sent a proposal to the government to help further develop the garden, so that they can pursue their mission of promoting Chinese medicine and herbs. It is not that there is no interest; what seems to be forgotten may in fact be too deeply ingrained. In China, a video that lists by name dozens of herbs recently went viral. "It turns out that the countryside by my hometown is covered in gold," wrote one online commenter. "In Sichuan we fed them to pigs and cattle," says another. Nicolette Perry cites a similar sentiment. "You definitely get people saying my grandma used to use this," she says of items such as liquorice root. At Hong Kong University, Wang, who also is from Guangdong, says that he has used the Lung Fu Shan garden to teach students. His university is installing a new herb garden. But much of the knowledge of herbs is in Chinese society conveyed through "the culture within the family". They might be used in soups, just as elsewhere a drink might once have contained a tincture. There are an estimated 10,000 types of plants and animals that can be used as medicinal resources in Chinese society, Wang says, compared with only around 1,000-2,000 that are used in "clinical practice" as medicines. Many of them survive "as a folk medicine in the community" but are "not really recorded as in the Chinese medicine textbooks". "The knowledge can be preserved still," he adds. "[It's] just not preserved in a very systematic way." For Chan, there was no time for school. But the earliest lessons still provided the deepest instruction. If you ask him the name of the plant he fed to his cow, a lifetime ago, he can remember it instantly. It is planted in a garden, shielded by trees, on one of the many paths winding through the Lung Fu Shan Country Park. Cing sing syu. You need to take the wood of the plant, clean it, chop it very finely, mix it with rice, and then into a congee. And now, no translation is needed, because the language is ancient, and it is in his hands. This is how you hold the cow's nose, and this is how you push down on its tongue, so that it will not reject the cure, so that it will, against all the odds, survive.

Why bronze matters in skincare
: New Delhi, July 24 -- When Kavita Khosa, a lawyer turned wellness entrepreneur, launched Purearth 12 years ago, she was clear that her beauty brand wouldn't be about chasing trends, but more focused on raising awareness about traditional practices.
This year, she won a patent for one of the brand's most innovative products, the Kwansha Coin, which merges the benefits of gua sha (used in traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM, for massaging) with bronze, an alloy hailed in Ayurveda for its therapeutic properties.
"Because of my husband (born in Hong Kong), I started going to TCM aestheticians, who would do gua sha with horn material tools to release heat, toxins, and pain, and improve qi flow (the flow of energy)," Khosa, an Iyengar yoga teacher who's studied Ayurveda, explains while talking about the idea behind the coin. "Eight years ago, I thought, why not marry TCM and Ayurveda?"
Khosa worked with artisans in Odisha, Punjab, and Gujarat, to create the coin, which is handmade, with perfectly rounded edges that sit well on the facial contours. She says the Kwansha Coin can be used to massage blocked energy in different areas, including the thumb and forearm.
Why kwansha, or kansa (copper), though?
"When I was a child my grandmother used to rub my belly with warm mustard oil in a kansa vatti (copper bowl), when I had stomach ache. While rubbing the tummy with a round bowl, she used to put the oil in my navel. I wanted to learn more about the kansa alloy as I grew older," says Khosa.
Unlike other gua sha stones, often made with jade or rose quartz, the Kwansha Coin has been designed to work on the contours and give the face a snatch.
Research shows massaging with kansa helps release toxins, heat and acidity, and improve imbalances in the body.
"In Ayurveda, kansa is believed to balance the body's doshas and enhance the nutritional value of food. So, whether you choose to eat out of a bronze vessel or massage yourself with it, kansa or bronze has only positives to offer for your skin and body," Khosa says.
Once launched in 2017, the coin was replicated by several brands, which prompted Khosa to file for a patent.
"We took over seven years, and hundreds of prototypes to finally arrive at a design and function we were happy with. Since we debuted the product before it was patented (she filed for a patent in 2018; the process was delayed because of the pandemic), it resulted in a lot of knock-offs," says Khosa.
"The system around registering patents is not the friendliest, but if a lot of businesses are there and represented and trying, I trust the system around it will change, and copyrights will be taken much more seriously."

China: Working Together for a Brighter Future of China-Tajikistan Relations
: Xi Jinping
President of the People's Republic of China
In this lovely midsummer season, I will pay a state visit to the Republic of Tajikistan at the invitation of President Emomali Rahmon. This will be my third visit to Tajikistan. I last set foot on this beautiful land five years ago. The famous Tajik poet Rudaki once said that nothing could compare to the joy of a reunion with family or friends. I look forward to my meeting with President Rahmon to jointly open up brighter prospects for China-Tajikistan relations.
China and Tajikistan, connected by mountains and rivers, share a common destiny. The ancient Silk Road bears witness to the 2,000-plus years of friendship between our two nations. Zhang Qian, a royal emissary of China's Han Dynasty (202BC-220AD), Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang), an eminent monk of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) who travelled westward for Buddhist scriptures, and Chen Cheng, a diplomat of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) all left their footprints of friendship in Tajikistan. Sogdian merchants, travelling across the Eurasian continent, facilitated trade between China and Central Asia, West Asia, and even Europe, and made distinctive contributions to cultural exchanges and mutual learning among peoples along the Silk Road.
Thirty-two years ago, China and Tajikistan established diplomatic relations, opening a new chapter in our relations. Over the past three decades and more, China-Tajikistan relations have stood the test of the volatile international situations and maintained the momentum of sound and steady development. Our overall relationship has made a historic leap from good-neighborliness to a strategic partnership, and to a comprehensive strategic partnership. Together, we are committed to building a China-Tajikistan community with a shared future, blazing a successful path for growing relations between neighboring countries.
-China and Tajikistan treat each other with sincerity, respect and trust. We firmly support each other on issues that bear on our respective core interests, particularly independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We respect the development path that each has chosen in light of our respective national conditions. We resolutely oppose interference in internal affairs by any external force under any pretext. As always, we understand and support each other on issues related to our respective major concerns. We take pleasure in each other's progress in development and national revitalization. We have established cooperation mechanisms in key areas, which provide an important institutional guarantee for furthering bilateral relations. President Rahmon and I have met 15 times. We enjoy a good working relationship and a deep personal friendship as we jointly guide the development of China-Tajikistan relations.
-China and Tajikistan both pursue mutual benefit and win-win in cooperation. China has long been Tajikistan's largest source of investment and its major trading partner. Our two-way trade was close to US$4 billion in 2023, reaching another record high. Such strong momentum has continued in the first four months of this year. Tajikistan was among the first countries to participate in Belt and Road cooperation. A number of China-Tajikistan joint projects have been implemented, including a cement plant in Yavan, an agriculture technology demonstration center in Khatlon, and an agriculture and textile park in Dangara. They have helped upgrade Tajikistan's industrial technology and created thousands of local jobs. The China-Tajikistan highway and the Vahdat-Yavan railway tunnels, which are built by Chinese companies, make places along the routes more easily accessible. Premium green produce of Tajikistan such as cherries, lemons and grapes have steadily made their way to Chinese households and are quite popular among Chinese consumers. It is particularly heartening that the Tajik parliament building and government building, which President Rahmon and I jointly launched five years ago, will soon be completed. They will be new landmarks in Dushanbe and new symbols of China-Tajikistan cooperation.
-China and Tajikistan remain committed to mutual learning through friendly exchanges. The Confucius Institutes and the Luban Workshop have helped train a large number of Chinese speakers and technical personnel, who are now a vital force for the development and cooperation between our two nations. The Sino-Tajik Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine and the program of Lifeline Express International Sight Saving Mission that provides free cataract surgeries for patients in Tajikistan have contributed to public health in our two countries through a combination of traditional Chinese medicine and modern technology.
The Culture Day programs, seminars on specific subjects, student exchange programs, and the translation and publication of literature in our respective languages have helped foster greater mutual understanding and strengthened the ties between our two nations. These initiatives are akin to small streams that will ultimately converge to form a vast ocean of friendship between our two nations. There are now nine pairs of sister provinces/cities between our two countries. This is another example of how our friendship has been growing with vigor and vitality.
-China and Tajikistan treat each other with sincerity and stand in solidarity in times of challenge. In response to COVID-19, our two countries pulled together in combating the pandemic. We provided each other with a large number of medical supplies, and China sent professional medical teams to Tajikistan to assist in its COVID response. Together, we erected an ironclad line of defense against the virus. We timely consulted with each other and took actions together to resolve the issues concerning the Karasu-Kulma Pass, and ensured safe and smooth passage through the artery route of transportation and logistics. China and Tajikistan have maintained close coordination and collaboration on the international stage, supporting and responding positively to each other's major initiatives. Both of our countries firmly uphold the international system with the United Nations at its center, the international order based on international law, and the norms governing international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. We both endeavor to contribute to safeguarding international fairness and justice.
China and Tajikistan are both at a critical stage of national development and revitalization. China is pursuing high-quality development and advancing high-standard opening up. The Chinese people are working in unity to build China into a great modern socialist country in all respects, and to advance the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. Tajikistan is making great strides on its path to realizing the National Development Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan up to the period of 2030. I look forward to my meetings with President Rahmon to discuss how best to promote closer cooperation and bring our bilateral relationship to new heights.
-We need to improve the top-level design for our relationship to ensure its steady development in the right direction. We need to maintain high-level exchanges as frequently as necessary, deepen our experience sharing on governance and build stronger mutual political trust so as to always keep the relationship on the right track. We need to deepen our cooperation at all levels and in all areas, and spare no effort to implement the top-level consensus in full so as to add an enduring momentum to the China-Tajikistan relationship.
-We need to expand results-oriented cooperation to provide stronger material foundations for China-Tajikistan relations. China will work with Tajikistan to strengthen complementarity between the Belt and Road Initiative and the National Development Strategy of Tajikistan up to the period of 2030 as a concrete step to boost our respective development and revitalization. We need to consider new measures for trade promotion and expansion, accelerate the construction of the key section of the China-Tajikistan highway, and open more direct flights in response to the travel needs of our peoples. Other areas of cooperation include high and new technologies such as new energy vehicle, solar panel and satellite communication. China will import more premium produce from Tajikistan, and encourage strong Chinese companies to make more investments in Tajikistan as a step to help modernize its industrial system.
-We need to deepen security cooperation and build a strong development security shield. We need to jointly act on the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, enhance exchange between our law enforcement and security agencies, crack down on terrorist, extremist and separatist forces such as ETIM, and prevent and combat infiltration and sabotage by terrorists and extremists. We should remain resolute in opposing any attempt by external forces to interfere in our internal affairs or to undermine regional stability, so as to provide strong and effective safeguards for the development of our countries.
-We need to promote people-to-people and cultural exchanges to strengthen public support for a lasting friendship between our two nations. We welcome more Tajik friends to China for sightseeing, academic studies, as well as investment, business and exchange opportunities. China will continue to expand cooperation with Tajikistan in such areas as culture, education, health and sports. I hope to see more exchanges between our young people and more exchanges at subnational levels. I also hope our people-to-people exchanges will be as frequent as those between relatives. The Luban Workshop, Confucius Institutes, and the Sino-Tajik Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine are expected to play a greater role. We need to accelerate the mutual establishment of cultural centers, and expand cooperation at subnational levels as steps to ensure that China-Tajikistan friendship is sustained through generations.
-We need to enhance unity and collaboration and help foster an international environment favorable for peace and development. The two sides need to step up coordination and collaboration on multilateral platforms such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the China-Central Asia mechanism. We need to practice true multilateralism and promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. We need to deliver on the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, stand up for our common interests and those of other developing countries, and make our contribution to safeguarding international fairness and justice.
A Chinese poet in the Tang Dynasty once wrote, One can enjoy a grander sight by climbing to a greater height. We from China look forward to working with our Tajik friends to draw a new blueprint for stronger China-Tajikistan friendship, write a new chapter in our mutually beneficial cooperation, and create a brighter future of our two nations.

Chinese scientists develop cure for diabetes, insulin patient becomes medicine-free in just 3 months [Healthcare]
: In a significant medical milestone, Chinese scientists have successfully cured a patient's diabetes using a groundbreaking cell therapy. This pioneering treatment was developed by a team from Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, the Centre for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Renji Hospital, and was detailed in the journal Cell Discovery on April 30.
Patient's Journey to RecoveryAccording to a South China Morning Post report, the patient underwent the cell transplant in July 2021. Remarkably, within eleven weeks, he no longer required external insulin. Over the next year, he gradually reduced and ultimately stopped taking oral medication for blood sugar control. "Follow-up examinations showed that the patient's pancreatic islet function was effectively restored," said Yin, one of the lead researchers. The patient has now been insulin-free for 33 months.
This breakthrough marks a significant advancement in cell therapy for diabetes. Timothy Kieffer, a professor at the University of British Columbia, praised the study, saying, "I think this study represents an important advance in the field of cell therapy for diabetes."
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the body's ability to convert food into energy, leading to severe complications if not managed properly. Traditional treatments involve insulin injections and constant monitoring, which can be burdensome for patients.
Innovative Approach to Cell TherapyThe new therapy involves programming the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells, transforming them into "seed cells" to recreate pancreatic islet tissue in an artificial environment. This approach leverages the body's regenerative capabilities, an emerging field known as regenerative medicine.
"Our technology has matured and it has pushed boundaries in the field of regenerative medicine for the treatment of diabetes," Yin stated.
Implications for China's Healthcare SystemChina, with the highest number of diabetes patients globally, faces a substantial healthcare burden. According to the International Diabetes Federation, 140 million people in China have diabetes, with 40 million relying on lifelong insulin injections. This new cell therapy could significantly reduce this burden.
Kieffer noted that if this cell therapy approach proves effective in larger studies, "it can free patients from the burden of chronic medications, improve health and quality of life, and reduce healthcare expenditures." However, he emphasized the necessity of further studies involving more patients to validate these promising findings.

Asia: Episode F: Factual Correctness
: With great trepidation, Eugene and Amy forge onwards to episode four, a numeral considered highly unlucky among East Asian cultures and languages for sounding nearly identical to the word for death.
Eugene offers a few corrections for episode three, beginning with mention of the Thai parliament passing a bill to legalize same-sex marriage. While the bill was approved by Thailand's lower house and Senate, it will undergo further review and then the king will have to approve it before it can officially pass.
Also in the previous episode, the Korean term for traditional medicine, hanyak, does not actually translate to Chinese medicine. Eugene noticed that although the English definition on an online dictionary said "Chinese medicine," the Chinese characters did not use the Chinese han (¿), but used the Korean han(Ø).
Eugene got help from Leejin from the Korean Service, who found out that there was an official change in the 1980s to differentiate between traditional medicine in China, and that in Korea, which does have its origins in China but has since diverged.
The Rundown
From the Korean Service comes a report that North Korean authorities have begun policing the way college students carry their bags. Students are warned not to carry their bags over their shoulder, but rather sling them across their backs or use their hands like good socialists. This mandate is the latest crackdown on capitalist behavior under the Rejection of Reactionary Thought and Culture Law, which has also banned wearing blue jeans, using South Korean words or products, cohabitating with the opposite sex while unmarried, collecting rent and watching or distributing foreign media.
The Lao Service reported that Lao authorities launched an investigation into Facebook videos showing a man fishing by throwing explosives into the Mekong River to stun or kill fish. The practice of grenade fishing (or blast fishing) is illegal due to its destructive effects on the underwater ecosystem, however, sources in northern Laos report that much of the fish sold at local markets is collected using this method. Fisherman, especially those abiding by traditional net fishing, have reported increasing hardships as the development of hydropower dams in the Mekong have decimated fish populations and displaced riverside communities.
How It's Made
On this episode, Shen Ke, a staffer from RFA's Asia Fact Check Lab (AFCL) joins us on air to discuss the ways in which disinformation, primarily from Chinese-language sources, is disseminated and how his team debunks it. Shen shares how he came to join AFCL and some of his favorite fact checks concerning fake election polls, and Eugene brought up one regarding Taylor Swift who DID NOT in fact say that the U.S. would be unable to protect Taiwan. Shen Ke is a pseudonym that the staffer writes under as a way to protect his identity, like Wilson and many other RFA journalists do.

Homoeopathy and public health: Collaboration for improved patient outcomes
: Ranjan, Sujeet. 
: Alternative systems of medicine serve as essential avenues for health and well-being for diverse individuals worldwide. Recognising the profound impact of traditional healing practices, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has underscored the authenticity and widespread use of indigenous knowledge across various communities, which has been pivotal in maintaining household health for generations. Traditional medicinal practices encompass a broad spectrum, including acupuncture, ayurveda, herbal medicine, homoeopathy, naturopathy, osteopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, and Unani medicine. Stakeholders are increasingly dedicating significant efforts to bolster the evidence base supporting these traditional therapies, thereby enhancing their safety and efficacy. The establishment of the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine by the World Health Organization in Jamnagar, Gujarat, India, serves as a testament to the global commitment towards advancing research and understanding in this field.
Since its introduction in India in the early 19th century, homoeopathy has thrived and cemented its position as an indispensable component of the country’s healthcare landscape. Given the myriad challenges confronting the healthcare system, encompassing social, economic, environmental, and behavioural determinants of health, the integration of homoeopathy alongside other Ayush systems of medicine is essential for devising and implementing effective solutions. Ayush practitioners collectively constitute a significant segment of India’s healthcare workforce, comprising over a third of all practitioners (43%), with Homoeopathy practitioners representing a substantial proportion (37%). Over time, homoeopathy has garnered widespread acceptance and popularity among the Indian populace, offering a multifaceted contribution to public health initiatives. The expansion of the homoeopathic system is evident in various metrics, including the proliferation of registered practitioners, accredited educational institutions, wellness centres, and outpatient departments offering homoeopathic care, as well as increased government funding, research output, and patient satisfaction levels. Nonetheless, these metrics pertaining to infrastructure remain relatively modest compared to the conventional healthcare system. Ensuring adequate resource allocation is imperative to scale up and sustain interventions aimed at promoting and expanding the reach of homoeopathy over the long term.
The integration of homoeopathy into mainstream healthcare represents a valuable augmentation of trained personnel and resources capable of significantly contributing to the well-being of the populace. This integration particularly facilitates enhanced access to healthcare services and options, particularly in regions with limited access to conventional medicine or for individuals unable to afford existing treatments. Hence, continued efforts in this direction are imperative.
An optimal healthcare scenario for the nation entails the integration of safe and effective modalities with conventional medicine, fostering a comprehensive approach to public health. Some research studies indicate that integrating homoeopathy into existing health programmes alongside conventional treatments enhances compliance and clinical outcomes in certain ailments. For patients grappling with chronic conditions, pain management, rehabilitation, or overall well-being, especially where conventional medicine offers limited efficacy, homoeopathy can cater to specific patient requirements. Furthermore, this gentle healing science resonates with particular demographics, fostering heightened patient engagement.
Beyond the clinical advantages, homoeopathy’s holistic, personalised approach, distinct from conventional care, holds promise for public health on a broader scale. Additionally, homoeopathy has demonstrated its significance in preventive healthcare, particularly in addressing infections, epidemics, and nutritional disorders. Policymakers must consider these facets when devising integrative healthcare strategies in India.
The absence of restrictions on homoeopathy’s use alongside conventional medicine for symptom management, well-being enhancement, and improved patient experience facilitates its seamless integration into mainstream healthcare. Effective incorporation of Homoeopathy into public health systems necessitates collaboration between Homoeopathic practitioners and conventional healthcare providers. Effective communication and collaboration can significantly enhance patient care outcomes.
Successful initiatives often entail collaboration among diverse stakeholders, including government bodies, non-profit organisations, healthcare providers, academia, and the private sector. Such partnerships facilitate the sharing of resources, the exchange of expertise, and concerted efforts towards achieving common healthcare goals.
Homoeopathy presents a potentially more cost-effective and accessible alternative to conventional medicine, particularly in regions with limited healthcare resources. It can be considered an initial point of care for such communities. However, it is imperative to emphasise the necessity for robust research to validate the efficacy and safety of homoeopathy for broader public health recommendations. Rigorous regulatory measures and quality controls are indispensable for standardising practices and products, ensuring patient safety, and mitigating adverse effects. Additionally, standardised training and stringent regulations governing homoeopathic practitioners are vital to delivering quality care and safeguarding consumer interests. Establishing regular feedback mechanisms enables course corrections and improvements based on acquired insights.
In essence, the role of homoeopathy in public health is undergoing evolution. As research delving into its effectiveness progresses, its significance may amplify, but addressing safety apprehensions and facilitating seamless integration with conventional medicine remains paramount.

The tools in a medieval Japanese healer’s toolkit: from fortunetelling and exorcism to herbal medicines
: Poletto, Alessandro. 
: Court physicians While less common than spirit possessions, the idea that physical factors could also cause illness appears in sources from this period. Since the late seventh century, the government of the Japanese archipelago had established a bureau in charge of the well-being of aristocratic families and high-ranking members of the state bureaucracy. Court physicians were also expected to ritually “rent” a place for a pregnant woman to deliver, producing talismans written in red ink that were meant to function as “leases” for the birthing area. Reading works like “The Tale of Genji” is not only a way to immerse ourselves in the world of a medieval court, one where spirits roam freely, but a chance to see other ways of sorting human experience at work.
: “The Tale of Genji,” often called Japan’s first novel, was written 1,000 years ago. Yet it still occupies a powerful place in the Japanese imagination. A popular TV drama, “Dear Radiance” – “Hikaru kimi e” – is based on the life of its author, Murasaki Shikibu: the lady-in-waiting whose experiences at court inspired the refined world of “Genji.”
Romantic relationships, poetry and political intrigue provide most of the novel’s action. Yet illness plays an important role in several crucial moments, most famously when one of the main character’s lovers, Yūgao, falls ill and passes away, killed by what appears to be a powerful spirit – as later happens to his wife, Aoi, as well.
Someone reading “The Tale of Genji” at the time it was written would have found this realistic – as would some people in different cultures around the world today. Records from early medieval Japan document numerous descriptions of spirit possession, usually blamed on spirits of the dead. As has been true in many times and places, physical and spiritual health were seen as intertwined.
As a historian of premodern Japan, I’ve studied the processes its healing experts used to deal with possessions, and illness generally. Both literature and historical records demonstrate that the boundaries between what are often called “religion” and “medicine” were indistinct, if they existed at all.
Vanquishing spirits
The government department in charge of divination, the Bureau of Yin and Yang, established in the late seventh century, played a crucial role. Its technicians, known as onmyōji – yin and yang masters – were in charge of divination and fortunetelling. They were also responsible for observing the skies, interpreting omens, calendrical calculations, timekeeping and eventually a variety of rituals.
Today, onmyōji appear as wizardlike figures in novels, manga, anime and video games. Though heavily fictionalized, there is a historical kernel of truth in these fantastical depictions.
Starting from around the 10th century, Onmyōji were charged with carrying out iatromancy: divining the cause of a disease. Generally, they distinguished between disease caused by external or internal factors, though boundaries between the categories were often blurred. External factors could include local deities known as “kami,” other kami-like entities the patient had upset, minor Buddhist deities or malicious spirits – often revengeful ghosts.
In the case of spirit-induced illness, Buddhist monks would work to winnow out the culprit. Monks who specialized in exorcistic practices were known as “genja” and were believed to know how to expel the spirit from a patient’s body through powerful incantations. Genja would then transfer it onto another person and force the spirit to reveal its identity before vanquishing it.
Court physicians
While less common than spirit possessions, the idea that physical factors could also cause illness appears in sources from this period.
Since the late seventh century, the government of the Japanese archipelago had established a bureau in charge of the well-being of aristocratic families and high-ranking members of the state bureaucracy. This Bureau of Medications, the Ten’yakuryō, was based on similar systems in China’s Tang dynasty, which Japanese officials adapted for their own culture.
The bureau’s members, whom scholars today often call “court physicians” in English, created medicinal concoctions. But the bureau also included technicians tasked with using spells, perhaps to protect high-ranking people from maladies.
Not either/or
Some scholars, both Japanese and non-Japanese, compare the practices of members of the Bureau of Medications with what is now called “traditional Chinese medicine,” or just “medicine.” They typically consider the onmyōji and Buddhist monks, meanwhile, to fall under the label of “religion” – or perhaps, in the case of onmyōji, “magic.”
But I have found numerous signs that these categories do not help people today make sense of early medieval Japan.
Starting in the seventh century, as a centralized Japanese state began to take shape, Buddhist monks from the Korean Peninsula and present-day China brought healing practices to Japan. These techniques, such as herbalism – treatments made of plants – later became associated with court physicians. At the same time, though, monks also employed healing practices rooted in Buddhist rituals. Clearly, the distinction between ritual and physical healing was not part of their mindset.
Similarly, with court physicians, it is true that sources from this period mostly show them practicing herbalism. Later on, they incorporated simple needle surgeries and moxibustion, which involves burning a substance derived from dried leaves from the mugwort plant near the patient’s skin.
However, they also incorporated ritual elements from various Chinese traditions: spells, divination, fortunetelling and hemerology, the practice of identifying auspicious and inauspicious days for specific events. For example, moxibustion was supposed to be avoided on certain days because of the position of a deity, known as “jinshin,” believed to reside and move inside the human body. Practicing moxibustion on the body part where “jinshin” resided in a specific moment could kill it, therefore potentially harming the patient.
Court physicians were also expected to ritually “rent” a place for a pregnant woman to deliver, producing talismans written in red ink that were meant to function as “leases” for the birthing area. This was done in order to keep away deities who might otherwise enter that space, possibly because childbirth was believed to be a source of defilement. They also used hemerology to determine where the birthing bed should be placed.
In short, these healing experts straddled the boundaries between what are often called “religion” and “medicine.” We take for granted the categories that shape our understanding of the world around us, but they are the result of complex historical processes – and look different in every time and place.
Reading works like “The Tale of Genji” is not only a way to immerse ourselves in the world of a medieval court, one where spirits roam freely, but a chance to see other ways of sorting human experience at work.

Reading works like “The Tale of Genji” is not only a way to immerse ourselves in the world of a medieval court, one where spirits roam freely, but a chance to see other ways of sorting human experience at work.

China Traditional Chinese Medicine Shares Surge on $2 Billion Takeover Offer; State-owned pharmaceuticals giant Sinopharm, which owns 32% of China TCM, made a cash offer to buy shares
: Qu, Tracy. 
: China Traditional Chinese Medicine's shares posted their biggest intraday percentage gain in over 15 years after its controlling shareholder offered to privatize the company for 15.65 billion Hong Kong dollars ($2.00 billion).
The shares of the company, also called China TCM, was last 23% higher in Hong Kong after rising as much as 26% earlier to touch a high of HK$4.32.
State-owned pharmaceuticals giant Sinopharm, which owns 32% of China TCM, made a cash offer to buy the remaining shares for HK$4.6 each after the market closed Wednesday, a 34% premium over its close at HK$3.43 on Feb. 8. The stock hadn't traded since then because of the Lunar New Year holidays and a halt in trading earlier this week.
Sinopharm said that it doesn't plan to raise its offer price for China TCM.
The company has over 18,000 employees and is headquartered in Foshan, Guangdong. Its products cover several fields including China-patented medications, herbs, herbal granules and chemical-based medicines.
"The offer is fair in the context of the previous rumored privatization prices," Arun George of Global Equity Research, who publishes on Smartkarma, said in a note.
China TCM's second-largest shareholder, Ping An Insurance, owns 12% of China TCM's outstanding shares and has a blocking stake but would be receptive to the offer, he said.

STEP BACK IN THYME: WELLBEING A NEW GENERATION OF HERBALISTS ARE GOING BACK TO BASICS, SAYS FIONA KERR [USA REGION]
: Kerr, Fiona. 
: Harriet Coleman starts every day with a cup of rose tea. In the medical herbalist's garden apothecary on the north coast of Cornwall, the wooden shelves are lined with jars: dried purple sage leaves, fennel glycerite, lavender buds. Like many others, Coleman's path to herbalism started with her own health issues: in her 20s she began suffering from burnout and gut problems, and was eventually diagnosed with coeliac disease. "Now there's not a day where I don't have herbal medicine. It's not something that I reach for just when I'm poorly. My go-tos are rose, to stablise hormone function; rosemary for focus and concentration; and chamomile, which calms the nervous system. They're like breakfast, lunch and dinner." Coleman, who has trained to clinically assess patients and dispense treatments made from plants, has gone back to the roots of healthcare. She joins others like Erin Lovell Verinder, who shares recipes for dandelion-root smoothies and calendula salve from her home in the hills of northern Tasmania. Or Lauren Haynes, whose Wooden Spoon Herbs tinctures are grown from her Tennessee kitchen. Herbalism draws on a tradition that goes back millennia. It was the original medicine for the masses; the work, most often, of women, who crafted cures using what they had to hand. Often the clues to a plant's power can be found in their common names: lady's mantle and motherwort have both been used in reproductive health. The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 80 per cent of the global population uses some form of traditional medicine. In August, the WHO held its first traditional-medicine summit in Gujarat, discussing how to tap into plants' power through scientific study and innovation. Every culture has its own take, from traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, which originated in India up to 3,000 years ago, to old-wives'-tale remedies that pass down in kitchens around the world. "I'm Trinidadian on my mother's side and there we call it 'bush tea'," says Brianna Cherniak, a New Yorker who runs her own small-batch apothecary, Moss Medicine. Today she focuses on women's health and nervous-system regulation with her tinctures, Bee Chill honey - blended with passionflower, holy basil and lavender - as well as concocting herbal smokes, which draw on the rituals of Native American and Caribbean practices. AS WITH MANY IN THE HERB WORLD, sharing knowledge is central for Cherniak; she recently launched a beginner's course with the online learning portal Now You Know. "Community herbalism is the foundation of it all," adds London-based herbologist Maya Jayaweera Thomas, who leads workshops at Chelsea Physic Garden. "I was with the Mobile Apothecary recently, which once a month sets up a cargo bike outside Bethnal Green station stocked with herbal products. They are free for anyone who needs them - muscle balms, immunesupport vinegars, decongestant rubs made with community-grown or foraged plants." Here and elsewhere people share their own stories with Thomas: of men drinking nettle tea in Morocco, or an Italian grandmother rubbing children's gums with sage leaves. IT'S GIVING PEOPLE THE POWER TO LOOK AFTER THEIR BODIES" Anyone can grow rosemary, thyme and sage in pots on a windowsill, or pick hogweed or cleavers (children's-favourite sticky willy) at the side of the road. "Even walking down the street in London, I notice at least half-a-dozen plants that could be used in remedies, like shepherd's purse or dandelions, just growing out of buildings or pavements," adds Thomas. "I always teach people about onion syrup: that was the first thing we learnt in herb school. It's an amazing cough remedy. Alliums - garlic and onions - are antimicrobial." To make it: take a sterilised jar, slice an onion and layer onion, sugar, onion, sugar. Leave it and then strain the syrup of f after a few days. "It's something that anyone can do." Becky Cole champions a similar kind of folk herbalism from her farm in County Antrim, and her book The Garden Apothecary is filled with recipes made with 20 common plants, herbs and weeds. "It's about redeveloping that connection with nature, giving people back the power to look after their own bodies and realising that is a skill for everyone," she says. In spring that might mean making a cold-water decoction from cleavers as a tonic for the lymphatic system or a nettle-vinegar tonic. In summer, a sunburn-soothing aloe vera gel. There are elderberry and rosehip syrups to support immunity, and warming remedies made from ginger root, turmeric or pine needles in winter. "A tincture of elderberry and echinacea is something everybody should have on their shelves at this time of year and is easy to make," Cole adds. "When people start working with herbs they also realise how calming and meditative it can be in itself: growing, picking, making." Coming back to herbalism is a way to root ourselves in our surroundings, to nurture our health with the rhythm of the seasons and focus on prevention as much as cure. "Because if we lose this knowledge of working with plants and plant medicine," says Coleman, "then we are losing a part of ourselves." All-purpose healing salve WITH BEESWAX AND LAVENDER ESSENTIAL OIL "This recipe is a must-have for any gardener and home cook," writes Becky Cole in The Garden Apothecary. "It works really well at soothing mild rashes, scrapes, bruises and mild burns. The lavender helps to keep the area clean, soothes and also encourages repair." 11/2tsp beeswax pellets 3tbsp lavender-infused extra-virgin olive or sunflower oil 7-50 drops lavender essential oil Double boiler Salve jar or tin with lid • Set up a double boiler over a low heat, then melt the beeswax in the top section (ensuring this is clean and dry first). • Pour in the lavender-infused oil and stir to melt together. Once the beeswax has melted, remove the double boiler from the heat. • Stir in a suitable dilution of essential oils. "I like to add 50 drops for an approximate 4 per cent dilution," says Cole. • Pour the salve mixture into the jar or tin and seal with the lid. Allow to cool and harden for 24 hours before labelling and using. The salve will last at least 12 months. • To use, dab a bit of salve gently on the affected area. Repeat as needed.

Singapore: Speech by Minister Josephine Teo at the Singapore Conference on Artificial Intelligence
: 1. Good morning and thank you for making time to be here in Singapore.
2. My team and I are keenly aware that many of you have taken a leap of faith to join us at the inaugural Singapore Conference on Artificial Intelligence for the Global Good, or SCAI.
3. Conferences with an AI theme are a dime a dozen these days. What does Singapore hope to achieve with its own conference, that is different and meaningful? Why is this a good use of your time? And what would encourage you to join us next time, and invite other like-minded colleagues to come along?
4. Whether or not these questions have crossed your minds, we feel we owe you a clear articulation of our intentions.
5. First, let me say we start from a place of humility, a genuine desire to learn and a firm belief that we must contribute.
6. Of all the things we want to learn about AI, it is to learn to ask the right questions, even if they turn out to be very tough questions with no easy answers.
7. In our short journey as an independent nation, Singapore has had to deal with many tough questions - of survival, relevance, and national unity. In seeking answers to these questions, we have benefitted greatly from the wise counsel of international experts.
8. For example, Dr Albert Winsemius, a Dutch economist, was Singapore's Chief Economic Advisor from 1960, not long after we ceased to be British colony. Against the conventional wisdom that was popular then, Dr Winsemius recommended that Singapore focus on attracting foreign investments and build up our manufacturing sector.
9. His proposals served Singapore well. At age 74, having advised Singapore for nearly a quarter century, he stepped down from the role. By then, Singapore had come to be known as an NIE - a newly industrialising economy.
10. I mention Dr Winsemius because he was a most respected friend of Singapore, whose advice we greatly valued. In the same way, we see in our SCAI delegates, respected friends who have also been generous with your advice.
11. There is, however, one big difference.
12. Our conviction is that when it comes to AI, it is not only what Singapore can learn from the world, but also what we can contribute to it.
13. Through SCAI, we hope to offer a platform for experts and thought-leaders to come together, to share knowledge and ideas to foster international collaboration - a brain trust, if you will.
14. This aspiration is, perhaps, best exemplified by our water story.
15. As you may be aware, water is an existential issue for Singapore. We are a small island, with a limited water catchment.
16. In the past, up to 80% of our water was imported from overseas. In the 1990s, when membrane technologies were maturing, we sent our people to learn this technology from the United States, so that we could use it to recycle water. The recycled water, which we call NEWater, now supplies up to 40% of Singapore's water needs.
17. Through NEWater, and other technologies like desalination, we have harnessed technology to overcome an existential problem. But we have not stopped there. We have also shared our experience freely so that others too may benefit.
18. Every year, we host the Singapore International Water Week, where international experts exchange ideas and solutions in water management. We promote continuous innovation in water technologies in the hope that it will alleviate global water shortages. The Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize is presented annually, to recognise outstanding individuals or organizations that contribute towards solving the world's water challenges.
19. AI has more often been compared to electricity than with water, as a general-purpose technology.
20. With this audience, I don't need to persuade you of the potential for AI to be a force for good, globally.
21. Enough has been said and demonstrated about the commendable applications of AI for drug discovery, personalised learning, energy optimisation, and many other positive use cases.
22. The downside risks are also familiar. AI systems have flaws, including bias and inaccuracies. They can be used by bad actors to create misinformation and cyber-crime at scale. They may also cause significant displacement effects to people and businesses, and its benefits may not be equally distributed within and across countries.
23. AI agents, acting autonomously, may behave in ways inimical to the interests of human societies. If that were to happen, and there is no reason why it cannot happen, then AI may present existential risks to the world, as much as water is an existential issue for Singapore.
24. Therefore, along with an attitude of embracing AI innovations, Singapore is equally committed to confronting its risks. And here is where we also see opportunity to contribute, through an approach which has similarities with Traditional Chinese Medicine.
25. Traditional Chinese Medicine - or TCM for short, is commonly practised in our part of the world, as a complement to Western medicine. Practitioners of TCM view the body as an integrated system. Their interventions are designed to restore balance and achieve health.
26. One treatment in TCM is acupuncture, which involves fine needles inserted into strategic points in our bodies. The goal is to stimulate the channels through which Qi, or energy, runs, to promote a beneficial, healthy energy flow throughout the organism.
27. In case you have never tried acupuncture before, and have trouble figuring out what I am saying, we have arranged for an acupuncturist to be with us all day tomorrow. If you feel stuck, or just curious, sign up for a 30-minute session, and maybe that will help you along. Consider this our contribution to helping you get into the flow while in Singapore!
28. Just as TCM practitioners strive for holistic health through a systematic approach, the system-orientation may well be the most robust approach to considering our strategies and efforts to address the opportunities and risks of AI.
29. We have therefore convened SCAI with a systems-orientation. We are very grateful for the partnership of the Topos Institute, and I want to personally thank its Chairman Ilyas Khan and CEO Dr Brendan Fong, for your intellectual rigour in shaping our program.
30. We are hopeful that this gathering, away from the hype and flashlights that so often surround AI conferences these days, we can find the strategic points on which to focus our efforts, while thinking about the whole system in which we and future generations live.
31. We believe that in doing so, we stand a better chance of arriving at a new equilibrium in AI development.
32. Specifically, our goal in the next few days together is to identify the critical questions of AI, that, if answered systematically, will enable AI to truly serve the global good. Asking the right questions gets us closer to the answers we need. That is how the world has practically eliminated smallpox, banned CFCs, and developed COVID vaccinations, but the articulation of these questions needs to be sharp and specific - needle-like if you will.
33. Two weeks ago, I attended a talk by Dr Lydia Liu, an incoming Assistant Professor at Princeton University, where she discussed her work on the delayed impact of fair machine learning. Incidentally, her work won the best paper award at the International Conference on Machine Learning in 2018. This was the second consecutive year that a Singaporean was a first author on the winning paper, after Dr Koh Pang Wei in 2017. Pang Wei is here with us today as a SCAI delegate.
34. Lydia's work showed that applying common algorithmic fairness criteria, for example, using credit scores as loan approval criteria, do not necessarily lead to fair outcomes for people over time. Instead, it is essential to go beyond pure theory to also consider system dynamics and interaction effects in order to make practical, positive impact. I found her conclusions to be very thoughtful. Lydia's spirit of moving beyond generalities, towards practical purpose, is very much in Singapore's DNA.
35. Similarly, for SCAI to be useful, we want to build upon declarations of principles, to deepen the conversations in concrete terms. We aim to systematically focus on the outcomes we want to achieve, identify the current state of the art, outline promising approaches, and articulate the means to measure progress.
36. Over the next three days, will we succeed in identifying a set of sharp, grounded, SCAI questions that help shape the global agenda on AI? We don't know for sure. SCAI is an experiment, and we will be collectively learning along the way.
37. But we know that we must try, because the age of AI is too important for us to sleep-walk into. Particularly, as a small country, constrained by the size of our workforce, AI's potential as a force multiplier holds much promise, provided we also help our people adapt effectively.
38. AI is, at the same time, a technology that no country can stop from entering its borders, nor its effects from impacting its societies.
39. On cross-border issues, Singapore has long believed in the need for international cooperation. This is why we have actively contributed and occasionally played leadership roles, such as in the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea, in the World Intellectual Property Organization, the Open-Ended Working Group on cyber-security, and the Forum of Small States.
40. The Singapore Conference on AI for the Global Good is our latest effort. SCAI complements other initiatives such as the United Nations High-Level Advisory Body (UN HLAB) on AI, the G7 Hiroshima Process, the UK AI Safety Summit and its upcoming State of the Science Report. These initiatives focus on the governance of AI, the prevention of risks or how we might apply AI in solving global issues like climate change.
41. SCAI allows us to take a step back, to ask what we need to unblock in order to create pathways for AI development and deployment.
42. We also hope that the friendships and connections forged here at SCAI will be the start of an international brain trust, to strengthen international cooperation on AI, and focus attention on the questions that deserve our most patient and persistent investigations.
43. A brain trust to address the complex issues in AI will require diverse perspectives. As such, SCAI delegates come from 16 different countries, and different disciplines and parts of the ecosystem, such as industry, venture capitalism, as well as government and nonprofits.
44. Four individuals in attendance today also serve on the UN HLAB. They are Jaan Tallinn, Marietje Schaake, Professor Alondra Nelson, and one of our Conference Directors, Dr He Ruimin. After SCAI, they will be flying off to New York for the first in-person meeting of the UN HLAB. Many other delegates are also flying off to other conferences, such as the Global Partnership on AI in India, for example.
45. Thank you for taking time to be here despite the exhausting travel schedule you have committed to. I hope you will bring insights from this conference to wherever you are headed, so that we can grow this community globally.
46. Likewise, for all our delegates, we cannot thank you enough for being willing to join Singapore in this endeavour.
47. We hope you will find this a meaningful use of your time, to build the brain trust that will help to truly bring about AI for the Global Good.
48. Thank you!

The govt's plan to certify India's esoteric healers is a bad idea
: New Delhi, Jan. 1 -- The government's proposal to certify practitioners of traditional medicine, those who do not have a medical qualification or standardised professional training but still seem to be effective at what they do, is a bad idea. The government would do well to abandon such a move.
What it should do, instead, is try and understand the science behind esoteric practices that have no place in the standard medical practice taught in recognised medical colleges but are effective in the real world.
Research into such practices might help understand what makes them tick and thus make them safer for patients. This is important given how patients flock to traditional healers based on faith and word of mouth rather than on science despite the risk of harm, which typically goes unrecorded in the absence of a regulating entity.
There is, indeed, considerable traditional knowledge spread out across India's vast cultural geography that rural, and often urban, Indians have been drawing on to find remedies, including for emergencies such as snake bites and illness of many kinds. There's a famous family in Hyderabad that administers a preparation of live fish to patients of asthma, which has for decades drawn international media coverage.
Rural India has traditionally lacked access to modern healthcare and relied on traditional medical practitioners. Such practitioners do not necessarily belong to any identifiable school of curative practice, such as ayurveda, unani or siddha. There is a specialist institute in Bengaluru trying to unravel the science underlying ayurveda.
Ayurveda works on a theory of balance among three humours-air, phlegm and bile-to keep the human body in good health. It treats disease for the imbalance detected by an ayurvedic physician. This theory fits ill with the modern scientific understanding of diseases being caused by germs that manage to surmount the defence put up by the body's immune system.
However, many ayurvedic curative regimes are backed up by centuries of empirical experimentation and practice. How the practice can be explained by science needs to be investigated using modern tools of research, more extensively and comprehensively than has been accomplished so far.
But there are lots of so-called miracle cures at work in India's vast expanse. People set bones, cure back aches by stretching spines using alarming techniques, and offer single-herb/root remedies to dissolve kidney stones. Instead of dismissing all this as quackery, the government must institute proper research to understand these.
One of the winners of the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine went to Chinese scientist Youyou Tu, who identified the chemical artemisinin, found in a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating malaria. Finding the science behind the curative properties of traditional medicine in India could yield scores of Nobel-worthy discoveries.
However, till such an understanding of traditional curative practices, the government would do well to stay away from certifying practitioners of traditional medicine.
The fundamental reason is that you cannot certify what you do not understand. What standards can you set when you have no clue as to the quantity, quality or process of the things at work in a cure that cannot be explained by science?
The only thing that a certifying body would have to guide it along is the reputation of empirical success. And reputation is something people already have access to, without official interference, which is why such curers have patients.
Imagine what would happen if the government starts to offer certification without any science-supported measurable yardsticks of performance. Some quack with access to influential politicians would wheedle his way into getting certified as being qualified to offer treatment, without actually possessing the knowledge or skill to be effective. This would harm rather than help people.
The government would do well to identify and catalogue all the different effective practitioners of non-standard cures, assign research teams to each one of them to scientifically ascertain the root of their efficacy in practice, and consolidate the findings.
Traditional physicians are often reluctant to part with detailed information about the specialty cures they offer. These are often passed down from one generation to the next as the family's main source of income. Their reluctance to make their knowledge public is wholly understandable. The government must offer intellectual property protection to esoteric knowledge and practices, and enforce their exclusivity.
Some skills are process-oriented, such as in yoga. While the gross form of a yoga pose is easily identified, unless there is proper understanding of how to train the muscles to attain the pose, often entailing gradual easing in with the help of assorted props, the only result of untrained attempts to force the body into that pose would be to contribute a harvest of patients to the orthopaedic.
In such cases, certification would have to be outsourced to ongoing schools of authentic practice, and consumers educated to stay away from the uncertified.
The right approach for the government, as far as traditional medicine is concerned, is to institute research to understand why what works actually does work, and to leave well enough alone until that is achieved.

Hidden struggles of PCOS: Bridging modern and alternative approaches
: Mathew, Biju. 
: PCOS affliction, medical insights, and the path to reclaiming life and health Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a complex hormonal disorder, has emerged as a pervasive and life-altering condition, casting a long shadow of physical and psychological frustration over millions of lives worldwide.
PCOS is a condition defined by its multitude of symptoms: irregular periods, acne, weight gain, and fertility challenges, among others. Yet, beyond these visible signs, PCOS can shatter self-esteem, strain relationships, and fuel emotional turmoil. It is a condition that knows no boundaries, affecting women of all ages, ethnicities, and backgrounds.
This special report delves into the human anguish endured by those afflicted and seeks the insights of medical professionals, both from the realms of modern medicine and alternative therapies, offering hope to those seeking to regain control of their lives and health.
The impact of menstruation stigma on Nikita Phulwani's PCOS journey
Nikita Phulwani, the Managing Director of By Niggi, an influencer marketing and communications agency, began experiencing symptoms of PCOS at the age of 13 or 14. She postponed seeking medical assistance due to the stigma surrounding discussions about menstruation during that period. Nikita recounted, "I wasn't getting my mensuration regularly, and I suspected I had PCOS three to four months before seeking help. I even remember taking time to confide in my mother about it."
Upon receiving her diagnosis, Nikita felt overwhelmed and anxious. She explained, "Knowing that I had a condition related to my identity as a woman felt like a heavy burden. I struggled with being overweight until the age of 28, and I was obese."
Nikita expressed concerns about how her lifestyle exacerbated her PCOS. She faced weight issues and societal comparisons with her peers. She admitted, "My weight was spiraling out of control, and my PCOS seemed uncontrollable too. I went into a state of denial."
Her treatment initially included contraceptive pills, but she had concerns about their long-term effects and discontinued using them. Doctors consistently advised her to lose weight, which initially appeared daunting. About three years ago, weighing 118.2 kg, Nikita embarked on a fitness journey. She committed to regular workouts (five times a week), adopted a balanced diet, increased her water intake, and practiced stress management. Her efforts produced positive results, with doctors noting a significant reduction in her PCOS symptoms. She proudly shared, "Since my second day of weight training, my period returned regularly."
Nikita emphasized how managing lifestyle factors without medication had reversed her PCOS symptoms. She remarked, "It astonishes me to see how, without the help of any medications and solely by taking care of the fundamentals, I managed to reverse my symptoms. I understand that different women may experience various symptoms and causes, but altering my lifestyle was the most effective approach for me."
To maintain her progress, Nikita remained active, engaging in training five times a week and doing cardio six times a week. She ensured she got 6 to 7 hours of sleep daily, consumed 3 to 5 liters of water, and avoided sugar and gluten. She emphasized her commitment to moving her body at least six times a week, stating, "I train five times and do cardio six times a week."
Living with PCOS: Battling anxiety and depression
Living with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) goes beyond coping with irregular menstrual cycles, hirsutism, and the looming risk of diabetes. It's not just about managing issues like acne, excessive weight gain, reduced fertility, or hair loss.
For me, the most daunting challenge is summoning the inner strength to confront this condition head-on, starting with the simple act of getting out of bed each morning. On most days, I wake up feeling utterly drained, burdened by a profound sense of hopelessness. I often spend nearly 45 minutes scrolling through negative news and content on my phone, desperately trying to avoid facing the emotional pain that PCOS brings.
In my experience, anxiety and depression are the most insidious and least acknowledged symptoms of PCOS. I received my diagnosis at the age of 14 and have carried this burden for 21 years. There was a period in my mid-20s when I thought I had it under control. I became fixated on exercise and eliminated almost all the foods I loved. During this time, I lost nearly 20 kilograms, which was a tremendous relief given my lifelong struggle with weight issues. Finally, I felt "thin."
However, my ongoing struggle with consistency eventually caught up with me. I began to slacken in my exercise routine and healthy eating habits. Before I knew it, the symptoms started to resurface, gradually regaining their hold on me in 2017-18. It all unfolded so gradually that it wasn't until mid-2022 that I mustered the courage to consult a gynaecologist. This decision was partly spurred by the realization that I had regained the 20 kilograms I had worked so hard to lose, especially after a debilitating leg injury that left me incapacitated for two months.
My initial doctor prescribed birth control medication, and another suggested Metformin, a medicine typically reserved for diabetes patients to improve insulin resistance. I endured it for nearly six months, but it came at the cost of severe acidity and indigestion. At this point, I had tried everything from fat burners to extreme diets, followed by devastating binge-eating sessions.
However, a turning point arrived about a month ago. I had grown tired of pumping myself full of medicines, subjecting myself to starvation, and succumbing to excessive eating, only to remain trapped in a seemingly endless cycle. I yearned for genuine change, and a conversation with another PCOS survivor opened my eyes to the truth: consistency is the key. "That's the only way out," she told me. The knowledge that I wasn't alone, that countless women I knew were battling similar or even more challenging symptoms, ignited hope within me. I'm now working on healing by extending forgiveness to myself and taking one small step forward each day.
Men should be educated about PCOS, and families should provide support
Mary Milan Abrao, an architect based in Dubai, was officially diagnosed with PCOS approximately three years ago. However, she suspects she had been living with it for many years before her medical diagnosis. "I visited several doctors back home in India when I presented them with symptoms that weren't typical for PCOS. I've always had extremely regular menstrual cycles; they occur like clockwork. The doctors always dismissed my concerns," said Mary.
"I've carried extra weight since my youth, and I attributed it to my love for food and lifestyle choices. In my younger years, I didn't notice any significant health problems and ignored the issues," she added.
It wasn't until college that Mary experienced rapid weight gain and skin problems, such as darkening around skin folds. Even then, she assumed it had to do with her dietary and lifestyle choices. However, three years before her formal diagnosis, she gained 16 to 17 kg despite not overeating or making significant changes to her diet. Her other symptoms included hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and severe cramps.
At this point, she decided to consult a doctor. The doctor suspected insulin resistance, which is often associated with PCOS. Tests revealed high insulin resistance levels and the possibility of PCOS, confirmed by an ovarian scan showing cysts. "It was a doctor in Dubai who finally diagnosed it," she said.
Mary's case of PCOS was classified as 'inflammatory' PCOS. "Following my diagnosis, I was prescribed Metformin (a drug given to diabetes patients)," she added. Unfortunately, I developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) after taking the medicine, prompting me to explore a more holistic approach to my treatment.
She embarked on a journey to address her weight gain and PCOS symptoms through naturopathy. Her strategies included maintaining a regular sleep schedule, practicing yoga, managing stress, and adopting healthier dietary alternatives, such as cutting out junk food in favor of home-cooked meals.
Mary worked with dietitians and coaches, took supplements, and found relief in walking and light weightlifting. Over the last six months, she has lost 3 to 4 kg. "I felt more content, relaxed, and peaceful," she said, attributing her improved well-being to lifestyle changes. This also helped her realize the connection between her mood swings and her condition. "I would also turn to sugary foods for comfort. This worsened the symptoms as it affected my mental health and confidence," she said.
Mary also stressed the importance of raising awareness about PCOS among men and having supportive family members and partners when dealing with this condition.
Bhavna sought alternative therapy to deal with PCOS
Bhavna Wadhwa, a finance manager at a medical technology company who also operates a home clinic for alternative medicine, turned to alternative therapy to address her PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) symptoms.
In 2013, Bhavna first noticed symptoms of PCOS, including an irregular menstrual cycle. Her doctors initially recommended Metformin and other medications to manage insulin resistance. However, she was unable to tolerate pills and desired a more natural approach.
Bhavna experienced classic PCOS symptoms such as hair loss, weight gain, and mood swings, which left her feeling uncomfortable and unhappy with her body. She described the sensation as feeling heavy and burdened.
Although Bhavna had the support of her family and friends, coping with PCOS proved challenging. She believed that her parents and previous generations didn't fully comprehend the condition. This lack of understanding was somewhat beneficial, but the medical community often portrayed it as a lifelong disease.
Bhavna's breakthrough came through alternative therapy and a PCOS-tailored diet recommended by a dietitian in Dubai. She combined these approaches, making gradual lifestyle adjustments that significantly improved her symptoms, including mood swings and ovarian cysts. She emphasized that it is possible for PCOS patients to enjoy certain foods like gluten and dairy in moderation, dispelling common fears associated with these foods.
To manage insulin levels and sugar cravings, Bhavna discovered healthier alternatives, such as snacking on homemade chocolate bars. She adopted mindful eating practices, consuming five meals daily, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. Additionally, she stressed the importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D levels and understanding that intense workouts may not always be suitable for PCOS patients. Instead, she found slow-paced, light-weight exercises, walks, and swimming to be more effective.
Bhavna stated, "PCOS is not a lifelong condition. Today, my body functions better than clockwork. I encourage people to explore alternative remedies and gain a deeper understanding of their bodies. I firmly believe in the power of conscious choices." As a licensed BodyTalk practitioner, she now helps women make positive lifestyle changes to enhance their health and quality of life.
What is PCOS, and how is it diagnosed?
PCOS is a complex endocrine condition affecting nearly 5% to 10% of women of childbearing age.
The incidence of PCOS is on the rise due to current lifestyle and stress. Having polycystic ovaries on an ultrasound scan doesn't necessarily mean it's PCOS.
A diagnosis of PCOS is made when two out of the following three criteria are present:
• Missed periods, irregular periods, or very light periods.
• Increased facial or body hair and/or blood tests indicating higher testosterone levels than normal.
• An ultrasound scan showing polycystic ovaries.
What are the common symptoms of PCOS, and how can they vary among individuals?
PCOS can manifest with a range of clinical presentations affecting menstrual periods, fertility, hormones, and physical appearance.
Common symptoms of PCOS include:
• Irregular menstrual cycles.
• Excess facial and body hair growth (hirsutism).
• Acne or oily skin.
• Male pattern baldness or hair thinning.
• Weight gain or obesity.
• Infertility.
• Acanthosis Nigricans: Darkening of skin in areas like the neck, armpits, and under the breasts.
What are the potential long-term health risks associated with PCOS?
PCOS is associated with obesity and increased insulin resistance, increasing the risk of diabetes, gestational diabetes (during pregnancy), hypertension, and heart diseases. Women with PCOS also have a higher risk of endometrial cancer, various mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, mood swings), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).
Are there different types or subtypes of PCOS, and how do they differ?
Insulin-resistant PCOS: The most common type, often linked to factors like smoking, sugar intake, pollution, and transfats. High insulin levels hinder ovulation and trigger excess testosterone production.
Pill-induced PCOS: The second most common type, caused by birth control pills suppressing ovulation. Some women may not resume ovulation for months or years after discontinuing the pill.
Inflammatory PCOS: Inflammation prevents ovulation, disrupts hormones, and leads to androgen production. Stress, environmental toxins, and inflammatory diets (e.g., gluten) contribute to this type.
Hidden PCOS: A simpler form of PCOS that resolves when the underlying cause is addressed. Causes include thyroid disease, iodine deficiency, a vegetarian diet (resulting in zinc deficiency), and artificial sweeteners.
What lifestyle changes can help manage PCOS symptoms, such as diet and exercise?
Exercise and a weight loss-focused diet can lower insulin and androgen levels, potentially restoring ovulation. Incorporate complex carbohydrates like peas, lentils, quinoa, and fibre-rich foods like fruits and vegetables into your diet. Limit or eliminate simple carbohydrates like white bread, breakfast cereals, and pasta.
Various exercises, including strength training, cardio, yoga, Pilates, or tai chi, can promote overall health and PCOS recovery. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can help with fat-burning and insulin resistance. Customize your exercise regimen based on your goals and capabilities.
What's the difference between PCOD and PCOS?
Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOD)
"Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOD) is a condition in which the ovaries produce an excessive number of immature follicles or eggs that later develop into cysts. This can lead to anovulation and infertility. The main contributing factors are poor lifestyle choices, obesity, stress, and hormonal changes. Fortunately, PCOD can be managed and controlled through lifestyle changes and weight loss."
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a metabolic disorder characterized by the overproduction of androgenic (male) hormones by the ovaries. This can result in anovulation, increased hair growth, acne, and in the long term, may lead to conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, depression, non-alcoholic hepatitis, sleep apnea, and even endometrial cancer. Considering its potential severity, lifestyle changes, as mentioned above, can also play a significant role in managing PCOS."
Available medical treatments for PCOS and how they work
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that can lead to irregular periods, acne, excess facial hair, or hair loss from the head.
Medical Treatments for PCOS
Oral contraceptive pills: These can regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce androgen levels.
Anti-androgen drugs: These can help reduce excessive hair growth and acne.
Metformin: This medication improves insulin resistance, which is often associated with PCOS.
Ovulation induction: This treatment may be prescribed to stimulate ovulation in women with PCOS who want to conceive.
Lifestyle changes: Dietary modifications, exercise, and weight management are recommended to improve insulin sensitivity and overall health.
How does PCOS affect fertility, and what options are available for women with PCOS who want to conceive?
PCOS can result in irregular or absent menstrual cycles, making it challenging to conceive naturally.
Fertility options for women with PCOS
Ovulation induction medications: Medications like clomiphene or letrozole are used to induce ovulation.
Intrauterine insemination (IUI): This procedure can enhance the chances of conception.
In vitro fertilization (IVF): IVF may be considered if other treatments have not been successful.
Lifestyle modifications: Weight loss and lifestyle changes can improve fertility by addressing insulin resistance.
What role does hormone regulation play in PCOS, and how can it be managed?
Managing insulin resistance through lifestyle changes and medications like metformin can help normalise hormone levels. Regulating hormones can reduce the risk of endometrial cancer and correct irregular bleeding, excess hair growth, and acne.
Are there any recent advancements or research findings related to PCOS that patients should be aware of?
Ongoing research in PCOS aims to gain a deeper understanding of its underlying causes and develop more targeted treatments. However, no groundbreaking discoveries have been made recently that can entirely revolutionise the way patients perceive PCOS.
Psychological impact of PCOS
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) can lead to a wide range of psychological symptoms, including anxiety, depression, mood swings, and low self-esteem. PCOS affects everything from one's self-conception and identity to social relationships, intimacy, and sexuality, according to Dr Mohammed Yousef, a Specialist Psychiatrist.
Mood swings can feel like rapidly fluctuating emotions, such as irritability, temper issues, sadness, and anxiety, all resulting from hormonal imbalances. There is a substantial body of scientific evidence linking mood swings to hormonal imbalances. The Psychiatrist, working at the Aster Clinic in Dubai, explained that anxiety, depression, and mood swings can be attributed to decreased serotonin levels in the brain.
Psychological issues associated with PCOS, such as anxiety, depression, mood swings, and low self-esteem, can be effectively managed through psychological treatments like relaxation techniques, cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT), counselling, or psychotherapy. Yoga and meditation can also provide some relief. If none of these treatments proves effective, medications such as anxiolytics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers can be considered. Combining medication with psychological treatments is often the most effective approach, Dr Yousef said.
How Ayurveda can help manage PCOS
An increasing number of women in the UAE who suffer from PCOS are turning to alternative medicine, including Ayurveda, for their treatment. The frequency of PCOS diagnoses has also risen recently, with some cases even affecting girls in the pre-menarche stage who show symptoms of insulin resistance.
How Ayurveda approaches hormonal balance and regulation in PCOS cases
While most PCOS cases involve overweight individuals, a small proportion of patients have a normal body mass index, making diagnosis and treatment more challenging. In cases of lean PCOS with irregular periods, we induce menstruation using ghee-based preparations. Stress management and attaining hormonal homeostasis are also given due importance.
In obese PCOS cases, the focus is on metabolic correction, weight management and insulin resistance correction. We address these cases through treatments such as Panchakarma (personalised purificatory therapies/ detox therapies) along with oral medicines. Detox therapies include vamanam (medically induced emesis), virechanam (purgation), snehavasti (oil enema), kashaya vasti (decoction enema) and nasya (nasal instillation of medicines). Along with the regularisation of menstruation, Ayurveda also places significant importance on ovulation and the quality of ova.
What lifestyle modifications and diet are beneficial for PCOS according to Ayurveda?
Regarding diet during Ayurvedic treatment, patients are advised to reduce carbohydrate intake and avoid milk due to the presence of insulin growth factors in it. Excessive meat consumption, processed and canned foods, and junk food should also be avoided. Limiting sugar intake is crucial. Instead, we recommend incorporating horse gram, sesame seeds, sesame oil, garlic, fenugreek, asafoetida, and jaggery into the diet. Yoga is highly recommended, focusing on asanas that target the lower abdomen.
Are there specific guidelines or practices in Ayurveda for long-term PCOS prevention?
Individuals who are mildly overweight may receive medication for approximately three cycles alongside lifestyle modifications. However, relying on medication for a lifetime is generally unsustainable. In such cases, an alternative approach like Panchakarma may be considered after some time, the duration of which depends on the severity of symptoms.
Many individuals effectively manage their PCOS for several years by adopting a clean lifestyle and dietary regimen. This includes maintaining an active lifestyle, ensuring adequate water intake, maintaining a healthy weight and hormonal balance. These changes help reduce the stress associated with PCOS, as women often experience elevated stress levels over time.
How does Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnose PCOS and what are the key patterns or imbalances associated with it?
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) approaches the diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) by considering a person's overall health and looking for patterns of disharmony in the body. TCM doesn't directly diagnose PCOS as a Western medical doctor would but instead identifies patterns and imbalances that may contribute to the condition.
Can you recommend specific dietary guidelines based on TCM principles to help manage PCOS symptoms?
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) dietary guidelines for managing PCOS symptoms focus on promoting balance in the body and addressing the specific patterns and imbalances associated with PCOS. Here are some general dietary recommendations based on TCM principles:
1. Balance Yin and Yang
(Balancing Yin and Yang involves harmonizing opposing forces or energies in your life to achieve equilibrium. It's about finding a middle ground between passive and active, dark and light, rest and activity, and other opposing aspects to promote overall well-being and harmony.)
2. Whole foods
3. Moderate protein
4. Healthy fats
5. Limit dairy
6. Low-glycemic carbohydrates
7. Herbal teas
8. Avoid cold and raw foods
9. Mindful eating
10. Hydration
What acupuncture points or acupuncture protocols are commonly used in TCM for addressing PCOS?
Acupuncture is a commonly used Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) therapy for addressing PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome). Acupuncture points and protocols can vary depending on an individual's specific patterns and imbalances, but here are some commonly used acupuncture points and protocols for managing PCOS:
1. Spleen and kidney points
2. Liver points
3. Conception Vessel (Ren Mai) points
4. Governing Vessel (Du Mai) points
5. Lower abdominal points
6. Auricular acupuncture
7. Moxibustion
8. Electroacupuncture
9. Individualized treatment
Are there specific lifestyle recommendations, such as Qi Gong or Tai Chi exercises, that can support PCOS management by TCM principles?
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers various lifestyle recommendations that can potentially support the management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). These recommendations are often tailored to the individual's constitution and may include:
1. Dietary modifications
2. Exercise
3. Stress management
4. Acupuncture
5. Herbal medicine
6. Sleep
7. Weight management
8. Regular routine
Can TCM help with regulating menstrual cycles and addressing fertility issues often associated with PCOS?
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can be a helpful complementary approach for regulating menstrual cycles and addressing fertility issues often associated with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).
Here's how TCM may assist in these areas:
1. Balancing Hormones
2. Ovulation Induction
3. Improving Blood Flow
4. Reducing Stress
5. Dietary Guidance
6. Lifestyle Adjustments
7. Personalized Treatment
Are there any TCM strategies for the long-term prevention of PCOS-related complications?
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) strategies can be employed for the long-term prevention of complications associated with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). These strategies aim to address the underlying imbalances in the body that contribute to PCOS and promote overall health.
Here are some TCM approaches for long-term prevention:
1. Dietary guidance
• Consuming foods that nourish Yin and Qi, such as leafy greens, whole grains, and legumes.
• Avoiding excessive consumption of greasy, spicy, or sugary foods.
• Incorporating herbal teas like spearmint or cinnamon, may have beneficial effects on hormonal balance.
2. Regular exercise
3. Stress management
4. Acupuncture maintenance
5. Herbal medicine
6. Lifestyle habits
7. Regular check-ups
8. Weight management
How can homoeopathy help in managing the symptoms of PCOS?
The homoeopathic approach is not about managing a disorder; it is about finding the cause and restoring the body's normal functioning. That is the primary aim of the treatment, as opposed to just managing certain associated symptoms of this complex disorder. In other words, it aims for a cure. A holistic analysis of all aspects of the patient reveals the factors leading to this complex hormonal disorder.
Once identified, these factors are addressed using homoeopathic remedies that stimulate the body to reverse the disorder and restore normal healthy function.
What is the expected timeline for seeing improvements in PCOS symptoms with homoeopathic treatment?
Patients usually start seeing changes in a few months. Achieving a lasting and permanent restoration of health may take up to a couple of years, depending on factors like age, lifestyle, and genetic background.
Can homoeopathy address the underlying hormonal imbalance associated with PCOS?
Homeopathic remedies differ from conventional medications in addressing PCOS. The traditional approach aims to oppose the results of a disorder or dysfunction, while the homoeopathic practice is to stimulate the body to restore normal natural functioning. While homoeopathy is suitable for all individuals with PCOS, its effectiveness depends on their ability to self-heal.
Is homoeopathy a suitable approach for all individuals with PCOS, or are there specific criteria for determining its effectiveness?
People with a strong healing ability respond rapidly to energetic homoeopathic doses and show rapid improvements. If general health or lifestyle is poor, effectiveness reduces, as homoeopathic remedies rely on the body's ability to heal itself.
Are there any precautions or contraindications to consider when using homoeopathic remedies alongside other treatments or medications for PCOS?
When using homoeopathic remedies alongside other PCOS treatments or medications, patients must remember that there are no contraindications to stimulating the body's most precious resource: self-healing. Other medications only interfere with natural healing due to their side effects.
Regarding dietary or lifestyle recommendations, homoeopathy patients need to change their diet and lifestyle, with the most common change being the elimination of all dairy, sugar, and processed foods.
Importance of seeking professional medical guidance
While it is essential to empower oneself with knowledge about PCOS, it is equally imperative to stress the importance of seeking professional medical guidance. Self-medication or unverified treatments can potentially exacerbate symptoms and lead to unforeseen complications.

Central Asia: Uzbekistan and China moving forward on electric vehicle joint venture: An update on recent developments in Chinese-Russian-Central Asian affairs.
: China-Central Asia Monitor. 
: Uzbekistan
China and Uzbekistan are making progress on an Uzbek-based joint venture to produce electric and hybrid vehicles. While all the pieces appear to be in place, a firm production timetable has yet to be established. The venture involves BYD Auto, the Chinese entity that surpassed Tesla in 2022 as the leading seller of electric vehicles, and Uzavtosanoat JSC. The construction of an assembly facility in Uzbekistan’s Jizzakh Region is well underway. BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu traveled to Tashkent for the JV’s signing ceremony: the agreement “provides for foreign direct investment by the Chinese company in the ongoing project,” a local media outlet, repost.uz, reported. No details were disclosed on when vehicles will start rolling off the assembly line. An initial annual production target is 50,000 vehicles per year. Output is expected to reach 300,000 per year at the conclusion of the venture’s start-up phase, Uzbekistan’s Ministry of Investment said in a statement. While in Uzbekistan, Wang met with Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev; discussions focused on expanding the scope of the JV’s operations, including parts localization and boosting export. The Uzbek JV appears to be part of an ambitious plan to turn BYD into a global powerhouse. “It’s time for Chinese automakers to upend the order of the global auto industry and chart a course into a new vast territory,” the South China Morning Post quoted Wang as saying in August.
Transport ministers from all five Central Asian states and China huddled on the sidelines of the Global Forum on Sustainable Transport, held in Beijing in late September. “Issues of developing transport and communications cooperation between China and the states of Central Asia, creating short and convenient transport corridors, and increasing transit traffic were discussed,” according to a statement released by the Uzbek Transport Ministry. The meeting produced a memorandum of understanding, but the details of its contents were not immediately publicized.
Kazakhstan
In a trade twist, Kazakhstan intends to purchase large volumes of jet fuel from China. Kazakh Transport Minister Marat Karabaev recently announced that Kazakhstan wants to develop its capacity as an air cargo transit hub, but lacks refueling capacity. The Central Asian state currently sources most of its jet fuel from Russia, but with the war in Ukraine dragging on, Moscow’s reliability as a supplier is questionable. Kazakhstan is now looking to obtain up to 1.35 million tons of jet fuel from China. Representatives of three refineries in China’s western Xinjiang Province are expected to visit Kazakhstan soon to conduct a feasibility assessment.
Kazakhstan is strengthening educational contacts with a variety of Chinese institutions. Al-Farabi Kazakhstan National University (KazNU) signed a deal with China’s Fudan University to create a double-degree program and facilitate student and faculty exchanges between the two schools, the Business Kazakhstan website reported. The pact also provides for joint research. KazNU also discussed a research initiative involving the Chinese Center for Technology Transfer of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) member states, the university’s press service reported. Such a deal would pave the way for Chinese companies’ involvement in research laboratories operated by KazNU. Elsewhere, Kazakhstan’s Academy of Logistics and Transport and the Nanjing Professional Institute of Transport Technologies have signed an agreement providing for the "joint training of specialists for the transport and logistics industry.” The agreement additionally envisages academic exchanges and the facilitation of technology transfers concerning transport and railway engineering," Forbes.kz reported.
Kyrgyzstan
When it comes to Kyrgyz beer, it seems Latvia is drinking everyone else, including China, under the table. Data released by Kyrgyzstan’s National Statistics Committee shows that during the first seven months of 2023, the Central Asian nation exported 1.18 million liters of beer to Latvia, making the Baltic state the top international destination for Kyrgyz suds. China ranked a distant second, importing 774,000 liters of Kyrgyz beer. Riga, the Latvian capital, has emerged as a party/binge-drinking destination for young EU citizens. The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, describes Latvia as the “boozing capital” of Europe.
Top Kyrgyz government officials have visited China in recent weeks, seeking to drum up more trade and investment. Their efforts have yielded modest results, with various deals worth $150 million being announced. Two cabinet deputy chairmen, Bakyt Torobaev and Edil Baisalov, made separate visits to China, during which both lobbied for fresh Chinese investment in a variety of spheres, including industry, energy, education and culture. A Kyrgyz government statement did not provide specifics on the investment deals outlined in a memorandum of understanding.
Tajikistan
Tajikistan is open to enhancing cooperation with China in the area of traditional medicine. Tajikistan’s Deputy Health Minister, Abduholik Amirzoda, recently met with a Chinese delegation led by representatives of the Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, according to the Sputnik Tajikistan media outlet. No specific results from the meeting were reported.

Breathlessness, hives, cough, allergies: These UAE residents are in serious trouble with over-the-counter medicines
: Mathew, Biju. 
: Beware, self-medicating is fraught with dangers of overdose and drug-drug interaction Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines often offer convenient treatments without requiring a prescription, but this accessibility can lead to self-diagnosis errors and misuse. Limited expert guidance may overlook underlying health conditions or potential drug interactions, resulting in major health problems. Here are the stories of certain UAE residents who found themselves in serious trouble due to OTC medicines and how they managed to resolve the situation. Additionally, health experts from both modern and alternative medicines share their insights, while residents who have never used OTC medicines explain their reasons for doing so.
'I was unable to breathe properly after taking OTCs for a long time'
Mina Kiwan, a communications professional based in Dubai, suffers from chronic allergies to pollen and dust, which often results in the blockage of his nasal passages. "I experienced a severe cold that led to almost constant nasal congestion. At times, I resorted to using over-the-counter antihistamines without a doctor's prescription," said Kiwan.
To alleviate his breathing difficulties, Kiwan turned to over-the-counter nasal sprays. "Initially, I used the spray three to four times a day, but eventually, I started using it every 30 minutes," he said.
Subsequently, he encountered a complete loss of sensation in his nasal cartilage. "This condition left me unable to breathe properly and devoid of the sense of smell. The situation escalated to the point where I required hospitalisation for two days. During this time, I underwent a surgical procedure to remove a small growth in my nasal cavity," he added.
Fortunately, Kiwan was connected with a skilled doctor who devised an effective medical regimen for him, and the plan included a safe nasal spray and another one containing cortisone. "Thanks to this competent medical professional and the revised treatment plan, I now experience significant improvements in my health," he said with a smile.
Doctor learns the importance of medical consultation the hard way
Before embarking on his medical career, Dr Syed Mouazur Rahman, a specialised periodontist at Truelife Specialty Hospital in Abu Dhabi, used to resort to over-the-counter medications for ailments ranging from mild to severe, such as headaches and fevers. "I would visit a pharmacist and request painkillers or paracetamol based on my symptoms," Dr Rahman said.
On one occasion, a pharmacist even prescribed antibiotics for his fever (This happened in India). "I confirmed that I was quite ill and took the medicine to save some money," he said. However, shortly after taking the antibiotics, he developed hives. "Intense itching engulfed my body, my breathing was laboured, and I felt like I was losing consciousness. My mother rushed me to the hospital. Turns out, I was allergic to the penicillin present in the antibiotic. I could've lost my life that day. Now, I prioritize medical consultations before taking any medication—despite being a doctor myself," revealed Dr Rahman.
'Self-diagnosis is always dangerous,' says UAE-based doctor
While OTCs are generally safe to use, the caveat is that they are so only if used in the right dose, for the right time, and for the right indication, said Dr Sundarrajan Santhanam, Specialist Otolaryngologist at Mediclinic Welcare Hospital, Dubai.
However, even OTC medicines can cause harm if taken in excess doses or for a longer duration, or if they are combined, said Dr Sundarrajan. "You can inadvertently double-dose yourself with paracetamol, as this ingredient is found in many cold and cough medicines, as well as in standalone pain or fever relievers. The same applies to anti-allergics too."
"If a person is on blood thinners and takes a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug like ibuprofen, they can run the risk of bleeding. It is also pertinent to note that herbal and alternative medicines are also classified as OTCs, and there may be interactions between these and allopathic medicines," explained the Dubai-based doctor.
"OTCs also have side effects, and one needs to decide if they are worth tolerating before taking them. Some popular cold and cough medicines can either cause sleepiness or might have the exact opposite effect in different individuals, and they can also cause hyperactivity in younger age groups."
Self-diagnosis is always dangerous, and the same applies to 'Dr Google' or any other AI-based diagnosis, warned Dr Sundarrajan.
OTCs and allergies kept me away from my pet dog
For over six years, Mangal Suvarnan, a resident of Dubai, had been taking OTC antihistamines at least once a day to cope with his severe allergies. Despite his love for the family dog, a Labrador, he had to maintain a distance from the 10-year-old pet due to the bothersome symptoms it triggered, such as a runny nose, coughing, and even throat closure that made breathing difficult. Nevertheless, he managed the situation.
Matters escalated from manageable to unbearable when his family decided to foster a playful six-month-old golden retriever last summer.
"Being around two dogs sent my allergies into overdrive, and a single daily pill was no longer sufficient," he said. Suvarnan increased his dosage to two stronger medications a day and invested in an air purifier to help him breathe without experiencing reactions. One night, his allergies were so severe that his face turned purple. He had to stay at a friend's house to sleep without any asthmatic reactions.
The situation worsened when Suvarnan moved to Los Angeles, United States, for work. The combination of springtime hay fever and the effects of his landlord's dogs forced him to take OTC medication at least twice a day to avoid gasping for breath. Realising that his condition wasn't improving, Suvarnan's family insisted he consult with a pulmonologist as soon as possible.
Upon visiting the doctor, he was prescribed a soft mist inhaler and several other antihistamines, which finally provided relief from his symptoms. He said, "I should've sought help much earlier. Now, I can play with our dog without gasping for breath every time I'm around him."
Herbal/alternative medicines should be taken after consulting a registered doctor
Persistent dry cough and how this Filipina found the real cause
Alma Manlulu, a Filipina personal fitness trainer, endured weeks of persistent dry cough. Despite trying various over-the-counter antihistamines, cough, flu, and cold medicines, her condition showed no improvement. "Finally, I sought medical help and discovered I had a severe infection. The doctor prescribed antibiotics, and my health rapidly improved," Alma said. "Following this incident, I resolved to refrain from using over-the-counter medications again. They proved to be both a time and money drain."
Self-medication led this UAE resident to serious health issues
Misguided self-diagnosis lead patients to wrong herbs: Chinese medicine doctor
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is founded upon the principles of the 12 Meridian Theory, a holistic approach to diagnosing and treating health issues, explained Dr Peng Gao of Beijing Tong Ren Tang Gulf Clinic.
Dr Peng Gao of Beijing Tong Ren Tang Gulf Clinic China boasts a repertoire of over 20,000 herbs, some of which have been employed in creating conventional medicines, said Dr Peng. Given their shared chemical foundations, the fundamental chemical principles exhibit similarities to those in modern medicine, said the Dubai-based TCM doctor. In each case, a doctor's responsibility encompasses diagnosing before prescribing herbal remedies to patients, according to the doctor.
Drawing from my clinical experience, I've observed instances where patients' misguided self-diagnoses led them to select inappropriate herbs, resulting in harm or even fatality, said Dr Peng, and pointed out that this unfortunate outcome sometimes arises due to a misconceived belief in the absolute safety of herbs.
Traditional Chinese Medicine and 12 Meridian Theory
In TCM, it is believed that there are 12 main meridians, or pathways, that flow through the body, each associated with a specific organ system. These meridians are thought to carry vital energy called "qi" or "chi," which is essential for maintaining physical and emotional well-being.
The 12 Meridian Theory consists of six pairs of meridians, with each pair corresponding to an organ system and its related functions. The pairs are:
• Lung Meridian: Large Intestine Meridian
• Spleen Meridian: Stomach Meridian
• Heart Meridian: Small Intestine Meridian
• Urinary Bladder Meridian: Kidney Meridian
• Pericardium Meridian: Triple Burner (San Jiao) Meridian
• Liver Meridian: Gallbladder Meridian
According to TCM, imbalances or blockages in the flow of qi along these meridians can lead to various physical and emotional disorders. Practitioners of TCM use techniques such as acupuncture, acupressure, herbal medicine, and dietary changes to help restore the proper flow of qi and promote overall health.
These UAE residents will never take OTC medicines
Sandra Martinho, a Portuguese author and homemaker in Dubai, feels strongly against picking medicines off the shelf. "I personally do not agree with this theory. There is a reason why the doctor is there. We are definitely not doctors to self-analyze our health and self-medicate."
She advised against blindly taking medication just because it is popular and used by many.
Tracey Inglis, a freelance events executive and homemaker from New Zealand based in Dubai, shares the same belief. She and her husband avoid using OTC medicines. "My husband, for one, has high blood pressure. We have consulted a doctor and only purchase prescribed medicines. I am definitely not a fan of self-medication."
Inglis said she works hard to stay fit and healthy. "Should I need further assistance with my health, I visit a doctor to address my concerns."
What are the side effects of regular intake of OTC medicines?
Over-the-counter medicines refer to medicine that you can buy without a prescription. They are safe and effective if the directions on the label or leaflet are followed. These medicines as used to treat illnesses and their symptoms, including pain, coughs and colds, diarrhoea, constipation, and acne, among others.
• OTCs could interact with other medicines, supplements or foods, resulting in unpleasant or dangerous reactions.
• Some people are allergic to certain medicines.
• People with certain medical conditions may not tolerate some OTC medicines. For example, people with high blood pressure should not take certain decongestants, a Medicine Plus report said.
• Many medicines are not safe during pregnancy.
• Many OTC medications are dangerous for children.
What are some examples of medicine-to-medicine interactions?
The human body processes each medicine differently. When two or more medicine are used together, they affect the body in different ways leading to unpleasant effects. The main medicine-medicine interaction types, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians, are:
Duplication: When two medicines have similar active ingredients, it results in excess dosage. When the body gets more medicines than it needs, it can injure the kidneys or liver.
Opposition: When active ingredients in two medicines have opposite effects on the body, it can reduce the effectiveness of both medicines.
Alteration: One medicine may change how the body absorbs or processes another medicine.
So when consulting a doctor, it's important to tell them about the medicines and supplements you take.
What's the medicine-food interaction?
When some foods change how the body processes certain OTC medicines, it's called a medicine-food interaction. In some cases, some medicines are absorbed better into the body after eating food. This is why medicines come with directions to eat before or after food.
Can OTC medicines trigger allergies?
Some people are allergic to certain OTC medicines, so take care when buying medicines you haven't taken earlier. Some medicines may trigger allergies in some people, so if there are symptoms like itching, rash, hives, and breathing problems, stop using the medicine and see a doctor soon.
How do you know whether an allergy is drug-related?
All medicines can trigger allergies in some people. According to the US-based Mayo Clinic, a drug allergy is not the same as a side effect. A side effect is a known possible reaction to a medicine which is listed on labels.
Symptoms of a drug allergy often occur within an hour after taking the medicine. Other reactions like rashes can occur hours, days or weeks later, and some symptoms may persist.
There's no sure way of finding out a drug allergy as medicines react with different people differently. Only an allergist can diagnose a drug allergy with the help of tests.
Who is at increased risk from OTC medicines?
Anyone can have an adverse reaction to OTC medicines. But some of these groups are at a higher risk.
• Senior citizens
• Very young children
• Pregnant women
• People taking more than one medicine
People who have the following conditions are also at a higher risk, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians :
1. Asthma
2. Bleeding disorders
3. Blood clotting disorders
4. Breathing problems
5. Diabetes
6. Enlarged prostate glands
7. Epilepsy
8. Glaucoma
9. Gout
10. Heart disease
11. High blood pressure
12. Immune system problems
13. Kidney problems
14. Liver problems
15. Parkinson's disease
16. Psychiatric problems
17. Thyroid problems
When should you see a doctor?
Seek medical assistance if you suspect allergy symptoms after taking medications. Go to the emergency room or call an ambulance immediately if you have any symptoms of a severe allergic reaction, according to a report on the website of the Ohio-based Cleveland Clinic. These symptoms include:
• Trouble breathing
• Difficulty swallowing
• Sudden weakness or lightheadedness
• Accelerated heartbeat
• Unconsciousness
What are the common OTCs?
1) Painkillers
OTC painkillers ease pain from arthritis, tendonitis, muscle strains, headaches, and toothaches, among others. The medicines are generally safe if the directions on the label are followed.
Risks: People with liver or kidney diseases should not take acetaminophen and NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and children under 18 should not take aspirin.
Side effects: Prolonged use of NSAIDs can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. They can also increase your risk of bruising, bleeding, stomach upset, and skin reactions.
2) Decongestants
Decongestants help relieve nose blockages caused by a cold virus, flu, sinusitis, or allergies. OTC decongestants are generally safe for short-term use.
Risks: People with high blood pressure and heart disease should use decongestants only under medical supervision. The medicine shouldn't be used on children under 12.
Side effects: OTC nasal decongestants may cause the following side effects: agitation, dry mouth, insomnia, rapid or irregular heartbeat, nose irritation, headaches, rash, heart palpitations and high blood pressure
3) Antiallergics
Antihistamines have been used for years to treat allergy symptoms.
Risks: People with an enlarged prostate, heart disease, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, kidney or liver disease, bladder obstruction, or glaucoma should only take antihistamines under medical supervision.
Side effects: First-generation antihistamines can make people sleepy. Other side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, restlessness or moodiness, trouble urinating, blurred vision and confusion.
4) Cold and flu combination medicines
Cough and cold combinations are used mainly to relieve the cough due to colds, influenza, or hay fever, and not for chronic cough. This combination of products contains more than one ingredient, such as an antihistamine (anti-allergy medication), a decongestant (to clear a stuffy nose), an analgesic (pain reliever), and a cough medicine.
Risks: OTC cough and cold medicines can be life-threatening for children under 6 years of age. Some drugs can be unsafe for people with health issues. For example, pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine and ephedrine could increase blood sugar levels, so diabetic patients must be very careful when using them. The risk of medicine-medicine interaction is also high.
Side effects: The combination medicines are also associated with increased blood pressure in patients with hypertension, hyperthyroidism or heart disease. So take medical advice before using them.
5) Cough mixtures
There are two types of OTC cough medicines: antitussives (cough suppressants) and expectorants (mucous thinners). Antitussives suppress cough by blocking the cough reflex, and expectorants thin mucous to help clear the mucus from the airway. Some cough mixtures may also contain pain relievers, decongestants, or antihistamines. The combination medicines are used for temporary relief from cough, sneezing, or runny nose due to the common cold, hay fever or other upper respiratory allergies.
Risks: The risks are similar to cold and flu combination medicines. People with diabetes should ensure the medication doesn't spike blood sugar. So also people with hypertension, hyperthyroidism or heart disease.
Side effects: Healthy people don't usually experience side effects, but some medicines can cause irritability, sleepiness, or dizziness. But prolonged use is not advisable for people with health problems and the elderly.
6) Medicines for acidity
OTC medications that can help relieve heartburn, indigestion or gastric acidity are antacids, histamines or H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Antacids help neutralise stomach acid, while H2 blockers and PPIs reduce stomach acid.
Risks: People with liver or kidney disease, heart disease, high blood pressure and pregnant women should consult a doctor before taking antacids. PPIs are not advisable for older people, people with immune system problems and postmenopausal women.
Side effects: Antacid complications are mostly found in infants or people over 65, according to the Ohio-based Cleveland Clinic. Side effects could include constipation or diarrhoea, gas or flatulence, headache, nausea and vomiting, stomach cramps or pain in the abdomen. Frequent or overuse of antacids could lead to complications like acid rebound (the body produces more acid), neurotoxicity (affects the nervous system), iron deficiency, weakened bones and too much calcium in the blood.
7) Laxatives
Laxatives help relieve constipation and promote regular bowel movements. They are used to treat constipation (infrequent, difficult or painful bowel movements).
Risks: OTC laxatives shouldn't be used if the person has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ulcerative colitis, kidney disease or diabetes. A doctor's advice is required for lactose-intolerant people and those who have had intestinal surgeries. So is the case for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Side effects: It includes bloating, flatulence (gas), vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, dehydration, headache and loss of normal bowel function. Excessive or prolonged use of laxatives can cause diarrhoea, intestinal obstruction and unbalanced levels of salts and minerals in your body.
8) Herbal products
Herbal medicines are products derived from plants to treat and prevent diseases. Also called phytomedicines, its active ingredients are natural compounds from leaves, bark, roots, seeds, or flowers.
Risks: It may not be suitable for people taking other medicines, people with severe health conditions, pregnant or breastfeeding women, the elderly and children. People who plan to undergo surgery should avoid herbal medicines as some interfere with anaesthesia and blood clotting.
Side effects: According to Medical News Today, some herbal medicines may cause nausea, dizziness, headache, swelling, upset stomach, breathing difficulty or an allergic reaction.
9) Multivitamins
Multivitamins contain a wide range of vitamins and minerals to plug any nutritional gaps in the diet. It's also helpful for people over 65, vegans and vegetarians, who may miss out on some vitamins.
Risks: High amounts of vitamins and minerals can harm some people. There's also the risk of exceeding the daily intake if the dosage is followed by a nutrient-rich meal.
Side effects: Constipation, diarrhoea, or upset stomach may occur temporarily. Serious allergic reaction is rare.
Like it or not, OTC medicines are here to stay. People should be cautious about using them. If symptoms persist, see a doctor. A doctor's prescription is the best medicine.

World: WHO convenes first high-level global summit on traditional medicine to explore evidence base, opportunities to accelerate health for all
: The World Health Organization (WHO) is convening the Traditional Medicine Global Summit on 17 and 18 August 2023 in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. Co-hosted by the Government of India, the Summit will explore the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development.
High-level participants will include the WHO Director-General and Regional Directors, G20 health ministers and high-level invitees from countries across WHO's six regions. Scientists, practitioners of traditional medicine, health workers and members of the civil society organizations will also take part.
In pursuit of health for all
The Summit will explore ways to scale up scientific advances and realize the potential of evidence-based knowledge in the use of traditional medicine for people's health and well-being around the world. Scientists and other experts will lead technical discussions on research, evidence and learning; policy, data and regulation; innovation and digital health; and biodiversity, equity and Indigenous knowledge.
Traditional medicine can play an important and catalytic role in achieving the goal of universal health coverage and meeting global health-related targets that were off-track even before the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. Bringing traditional medicine into the mainstream of health care -- appropriately, effectively, and above all, safely based on the latest scientific evidence -- can help bridge access gaps for millions of people around the world. It would be an important step toward people-centered and holistic approaches to health and well-being.
Heads of State and government at the 2019 UN high-level meeting on universal health coverage acknowledged the need to include evidence-based traditional and complementary medicine services particularly in primary health care, a cornerstone of health systems, in pursuit of health for all. Today, traditional and complementary medicine is well established in many parts of the world, where it plays an important role in the culture, health and well-being of many communities. In some countries, it represents a significant part of the health sector's economy, and for millions of people around the world it is the only available source of health care.
Advancing science on traditional medicine
Traditional medicine has contributed to breakthrough medical discoveries and continues to hold out great promise. Research methods such as ethnopharmacology and reverse pharmacology could help identify new, safe and clinically effective drugs, while the application of new technologies in health and medicine -- for example genomics, new diagnostic technologies, and artificial intelligence -- could open new frontiers of knowledge on traditional medicine.
Amid an expansion in the use of traditional medicine worldwide, safety, efficacy and quality control of traditional products and procedure-based therapies remain important priorities for health authorities and the public. Natural doesn't always mean safe, and centuries of use are not a guarantee of efficacy; therefore, scientific method and process must be applied to provide the rigorous evidence required for the recommendation of traditional medicines in WHO guidelines.
Advancing science on traditional medicine should be held to the same rigorous standards as in other fields of health. This may require new thinking on the methodologies to address these more holistic, contextual approaches and provide evidence that is sufficiently conclusive and robust to lead to policy recommendations, said Dr John Reeder, WHO Director of Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases and Director of the Department of Research for Health.
The Summit will explore research and evaluation of traditional medicine, including methodologies that can be used to develop a global research agenda and priorities in traditional medicine, as well as challenges and opportunities based on 25 years of research in traditional medicine. Findings from the systematic reviews of traditional medicine and health, evidence maps of clinical effectiveness, and an artificial intelligence global research map on traditional medicine will be presented.
A stronger evidence base will enable countries to develop appropriate mechanisms and policy guidance for regulating, ensuring quality control and monitoring traditional medicine practices, practitioners and products, according to national contexts and needs.
WHO global survey on traditional medicine, ICD-11 and other data
At the Summit, WHO will present emerging findings from the third global survey on traditional medicine, which, for the first time, includes questions on financing of traditional and complementary medicine, health of Indigenous Peoples, quality assurance, traditional medicine knowledge, biodiversity, trade, integration, patient safety, and more. The complete survey, which will be released later in the year, first on an interactive online dashboard and then as a report, will inform the development of WHO's updated traditional medicine strategy 2025-2034 as requested by the World Health Assembly in May 2023.
Standardization of traditional medicine condition documentation and coding in routine health information system is a pre-requisite for effective management and regulation of traditional medicine in healthcare systems. This includes consideration of forms, incidence rates, and outcomes associated with traditional medicine healthcare. The Summit will be an opportunity to showcase countries' experiences, explore regional trends and discuss best practices, including in the implementation of the traditional medicine chapter in the latest International Classification of Diseases, the ICD-11.
Participants in the Summit will examine a global overview of policy, legal and regulatory landscapes; formal structures and policies to collect data and establish systems for information management; an assessment of educational and training programmes for the development of traditional medicine workforce; and experiences and best practices on training, accreditation and regulation of traditional medicine practitioners, which can substantially advance patient safety and minimize patient harm in the provision of traditional medicine services.
Biodiversity and indigenous knowledge
Biodiversity and indigenous knowledge are foundational pillars of traditional medicine and health and well-being, especially for Indigenous Peoples; 80 per cent of the world's remaining biodiversity is in Indigenous territories or lands, while conservation of biodiversity is a key issue related to the sustainable use of traditional medicines.
In preparation for the Summit, a WHO global workshop on biodiversity, indigenous knowledge, health, and well-being was held in Brazil from 25 to 28 July, to better understand the invaluable connection between biodiversity, traditional knowledge, and human health. Meeting outcomes, in the form of recommendations, will be presented at the Summit, and will contribute to the biodiversity and One Health workstream.
The Summit's focus on sustainable biodiversity management in the face of the climate crisis will drive the identification and sharing of best practices, initiatives, and legislative frameworks on the protection of traditional knowledge, innovation, and access and equitable benefit-sharing by countries. The discussions at the Summit will focus on the rising prospect of global economic activities related to traditional medicine, Indigenous knowledge-based innovations in health care, application of intellectual property laws and regulations, and the use and promotion of indigenous and ancestral medicine through intercultural dialogues to support community health.
Notes to the editor
About the Summit
The 2023 WHO Traditional Medicine Global Summit is organized by the WHO Global Traditional Medicine Centre, and is co-hosted by the Government of India, which holds the G20 presidency in 2023 under the theme One Earth, One Family, One Future. This will be the first in a series of WHO global summits on traditional medicine, which will be held every other year in different WHO regions.
Why now
For centuries, traditional, indigenous and ancestral knowledge has been an integral resource for health in households and communities, and it continues to form a significant part of healthcare in many regions: 170 of the WHO's 194 Member States have reported on the use of herbal medicines, acupuncture, yoga, indigenous therapies and other forms of traditional medicines; many recognize traditional medicine as a valuable source of healthcare and have taken steps to integrate practices, products and practitioners into their national systems.
Today, traditional medicine has become a global phenomenon: demand is growing, with patients seeking greater agency and ownership of their health and well-being and seeking more compassionate and personalized health care. For millions, especially those living in remote and rural areas, it continues to be the first port of call for health and well-being, offering care that is culturally acceptable, available and affordable.
WHO work on traditional medicine
WHO traditional medicine programme started in 1976; today, through its Traditional, Complementary and Integrative medicine Unit, WHO is working with countries on developing standards and benchmarks for the training and practice of different systems of traditional medicine, and for their evidence-based integration in the International Classification of diseases (ICD).
The 11th revision of ICD (ICD-11), which came into effect on 1 January 2022, includes a chapter on traditional medicine for dual and optional coding, which is based on traditional medicine originated in ancient Chinese Medicine (now commonly used in China, Japan, Republic of Korea and elsewhere around the world). WHO is developing the next module in traditional medicine chapter, which will include diagnostic terms of Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha systems of medicine.
WHO is implementing its second Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023, focused on developing norms, standards and technical documents based on reliable information and data to support Member States in providing safe, qualified and effective traditional and complementary medicine services, and their appropriate integration into health systems. The development of an updated strategy for 2025-2034 period was requested by the Member States at the World Health Assembly in May 2023.
In 2022, with the support of the Government of India, WHO set up the WHO Global Traditional Medicine Centre in response to the increased global interest and demand for evidence-based traditional medicine. It is the first and only WHO global centre dedicated to traditional medicine. This knowledge hub focuses on partnership, evidence, data, biodiversity, and innovation to optimise the contribution of traditional medicine to global health, universal health coverage, and sustainable development, and is guided by respect for local heritages, resources, and rights.
The third global survey on traditional medicine is designed to monitor the progress in the performance of traditional and complementary systems, to better understand their role, function and impact in countries' health systems and to align with WHO and global monitoring frameworks. The results will support the development of new traditional medicine strategy 2025-2034. The survey is building on the previous global surveys conducted in 2001 and 2012, with follow-up data collected between 2016 and 2018. The results were published in the 2019 WHO Global report on traditional and complementary medicine. Two T&CM indicators were included in the Global reference list of 100 core health Indicators (and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals).

Vibrant activity among top traded stocks on SGX
: Howie, Geoff. 
: THIS year, close to a quarter of Singapore's 100 most actively traded stocks have registered double-digit percentage growth in daily trading turnover from their respective 2022 levels.
Of the 23 stocks, 21 saw increased average daily trading turnover on the back of trading volume rather than price gains. These 23 stocks have in total seen on average S$202 million in shares changing hands daily so far this year, compared to S$113 million in 2022.
These include six Straits Times Index (STI) constituents, which comprised Singapore Airlines, Seatrium, Genting Singapore, Sembcorp Industries, Sats and Thai Beverage. These six stocks averaged 15 per cent price gains over the 2023 year through to Jul 26, while averaging 80 per cent higher daily trading turnover.
Seatrium A significant corporate action underscored Seatrium's increased trading volume while bolstering its market capitalisation to a level that it displaced Keppel DC Reit in the STI in the most recent quarterly rebalancing.
The combination of Sembcorp Marine and Keppel Offshore & Marine, was completed in February, allowing for the newly branded Seatrium to scale up and accelerate its advance into the cleaner and greener O&M market, offshore renewables, and new energy.
Seatrium's net order book stands at S$19.73 billion, with as much as 40 per cent of this from renewables and cleaner/green solutions. Progressive deliveries are till 2030.
Seatrium has averaged a daily trading turnover of S$43 million over the first 30 weeks of 2023, compared to averaging S$15 million over 2022. This has seen it rank as the sixth most traded stock by trading turnover so far this year, up from ranking the 23rd most traded in 2022.
At the same time, Keppel Corporation has maintained its ranking as the eleventh most traded Singapore stock in both timeframes.
Food Empire Holdings Food Empire Holdings has posted a 75 per cent price gain in the 2023 year to July 26, while its average daily trading turnover has soared to S$796,000, from S$130,000 in 2022. This saw the stock rank among the 85 most traded stocks so far this year, after ranking just outside the 170 most traded stocks in 2022.
The portfolio of the multinational food and beverage manufacturing and distribution group spans instant beverages, snack foods, with a growing presence in food ingredients. Its products are sold in over 60 countries across North Asia, Eastern Europe, South-east Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, Middle East, and North America. Its operations are supported by eight manufacturing facilities in five countries and 23 offices worldwide.
After booking record revenue and net profit for its FY22 (ended Dec 31), Food Empire Holdings' Q1FY23 business update saw revenue increase 24 per cent and net profit increase 51 per cent, from a low base in Q1FY22. The group is expected to report its H1FY23 results in mid-August.
In April, Food Empire Holdings chairman, Tan Wang Cheow, highlighted that on a group-wide basis, its objective is to increase the revenue stream in other markets and reduce the proportion of revenue derived from the Russia market through organic and inorganic growth strategies in the longer run.
Tan is a founder of the group and has been instrumental in guiding the company''s business, including taking it public in 2000. As a passionate believer in the power of brands, Tan is actively involved in the marketing and branding activities across the group.
TJ DaRenTang While it's traded in US dollars, Tianjin Pharmaceutical Da Ren Tang Group Corporation (Da Ren Tang Group) has averaged daily trading turnover of S$1 million for the 2023 year through to Jul 26.
This is up significantly from S$183,000 in 2022. While turnover has grown more than fivefold, the stock generated an 89 per cent price gain in Singapore dollar terms.
After ranking around the 150 most traded Singapore stocks in 2022, the stock has ranked as a top 80 stock by turnover for the first 30 weeks of 2023.
Da Ren Tang Group is the core pharmaceutical manufacturing arm of Tianjin Pharmaceutical Holdings, with green Chinese traditional medicine as its core business.
It is equipped with a complete industry chain, product chain and talent chain integrating production, management, and scientific research.
Its business also covers multiple areas including research, development and manufacturing of Chinese herbal medicines, proprietary Chinese medicines, chemical raw materials and preparations and nutritional and health products as well as pharmaceutical commerce.
In its Q1FY23 (ended Mar 31) Da Ren Tang Group reported an attributable net profit of 400 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 101 per cent. This followed a net profit of 860 million yuan in its FY22, which was a year-on-year increase of 12 per cent from FY21.
Last year, China policymakers pursued a series of in-depth reforms to medical and health systems, while at the same time placing great importance to the development of traditional Chinese medicine.
In April, Da Ren Tang Group chairman, Zhang Mingrui, said that the group had been essentially also moving with the times and was pursuing strategic development in eight key areas, including marketing focus, organisation optimisation, platform integration, talent motivation, effective innovation, cost control and loss minimisation, digital empowerment, and cultural synergy.
Delfi Delfi has also ranked among the 80 most traded Singapore stocks this year, while generating a 70 per cent price gain. Last year Delfi ranked among the top 140 traded stocks by turnover. Delfi has an established portfolio of chocolate confectionery brand names in Indonesia including SilverQueen and Ceres which were introduced in the 1950s and Delfi in the 1980s.
For its Q1FY23 (ended Mar 31), Delfi recorded 21 per cent year-on-year revenue growth, following 19 per cent revenue growth in FY22.
The Q1FY23 revenue was driven by consumer demand producing robust growth in both its own brands and agency brands, spanning both Indonesia and its regional markets. Indonesia contributes more than two-thirds of Delfi's revenue.
Statista highlighted in April that the Indonesian retail sector has been rapidly growing, contributing around 13 per cent to the country's gross domestic product. The report added that with its relatively large population of more than 270 million, the growing middle class with higher purchasing power, and millennials with bigger spending habits, Indonesia holds significant potential for the retail market.
Paralleling this, Delfi expects its business momentum to carry through for most of 2023 and thus remains focused on executing growth strategies for its core brands, strengthening distribution capabilities, and supporting growth in its regional businesses.
Flows The 23 stocks booked combined net institutional inflow of S$395 million in the 2023 year to Jul 26.
As many as seven of the 23 stocks represented the industrial sector with the seven stocks seeing combined net institutional inflow of S$180 million. Note that the 23 stocks in the table do not include stocks that have been subject to takeover offers in 2023 or were suspended in part in 2022.

Why it might be a good idea to use the Chinese footbath for a better night’s sleep
: Zhang, Xuena. 
: The importance of feet in Chinese medicine and detoxification Dubai: One of my 90-year-old Chinese grandpa's favourite things to do is to soak his feet in warm water before going to bed. He would often make a relaxation sound and doze off shortly after that. He's been doing this ever since he was young.
My grandpa is not the only one in my family who likes to take a footbath before bed. For many Chinese, footbath is a habit.
'Growing a tree begins with taking care of its root'
There is a saying in Chinese medicine, 'Growing a tree begins with taking care of its root. Maintaining good health starts with one's feet.' Xin Liu, a Chinese medicine doctor living in Dubai, spoke to Gulf News regarding the importance of feet in Chinese medicine.
"Traditional Chinese medicine believes that the soles of our feet have reflex areas corresponding to various organs and tissues of the body. Massaging and stimulating the reflex zones of the feet can help in regulating and improving the function of related organs.
"Meanwhile, the meridians and acupoints of the human body meet at the feet to form a complete system. Stimulations on specific points on the feet can unblock the meridians, regulate the flow of Qi and blood, and enhance the health and balance of the body.
"In addition, there are sweat glands on the soles of our feet. A warm footbath facilitates sweating through these glands, which contributes to detoxification to some degree."
What are acupoints, Qi and meridians? In acupuncture and Chinese medicine, acupoints are any of the supposed energy points on the body where acupuncture needles are inserted or manual pressure is applied during acupressure. A meridian means each of a set of pathways in the body along which vital energy is said to flow.
In Chinese philosophy, qi, is the life force that every person and thing has - it stands for the energy in everything. Chinese medicine and acupuncture both address the concept.
Source: Oxford Languages and vocabulary.com "Footbath was recorded in China's earliest medical classic 'Huangdi Neijing'," Yi Zhao, associate professor for School of Humanities of Jiangnan University, said in an interview to a Chinese journalist, Hong Xing, in an article on a Chinese community website - sohu.com. 'Huangdi Neijing' was drafted throughout the Warring States period, the Qin dynasty and the Han dynasty, which lasted from 475 BC to 220 AD, marking a history of footbath for at least over two millennia.
What footbath lovers have to say
'It's a little treat to myself'
Dubai-based makeup artist, Meimei Lin, often has cold feet in an environment with strong air conditioning, she described how a warm footbath comes to the rescue. "The air conditioning in my office can be strong sometimes, and because of it, my feet and lower legs are often cold. The coldness even brings about stomach discomfort - it's a chain effect. A warm footbath, in this case, usually saves my day. It's a time of relaxation - I feel a warm sensation extending from my feet to my whole body. All my nerves are loosened up. I would even sweat a bit, which feels like a detoxification process."
A footbath makes exfoliation on my heels easier - this has been my secret for having smooth heels.
- Dubai-based makeup artist, Meimei Lin
Lin also likes to treat herself during this time of unwinding. "I like to infuse the water with tea leaves, saffron, or essential oils. The scent of these ingredients puts me in a good mood. Generally, I sleep better after my little treat. Besides, a footbath makes exfoliation on my heels easier - this has been my secret for having smooth heels."
Lin is not the only one in her family, who keeps this habit. Her mother, 60 years of age, adores footbaths, too. "My mother takes her footbath in the morning, before she starts her day. She says it activates her body and mind."
'Footbath drives away tiredness at the end of a work day'
For Ming Qi, a Dubai-based photographer, a warm footbath drives away tiredness at the end of a work day. "I'm a photographer, so I stand and walk a lot. Consequently, I usually have sore legs and feet in the evening. Footbath becomes the perfect remedy in this situation - it almost instantly lifts the heaviness in my legs.
The sensation of warm water, combined with a massage, prepares me for a sound sleep at night. The next morning, I feel well-rested for a busy day.
- Ming Qi, a Dubai-based photographer
"In China, there are various kinds of footbath buckets in the market, some of which even have a built-in massage function. The sensation of warm water, combined with a massage, prepares me for a sound sleep at night. The next morning, I feel well-rested for a busy day."
A mini meditative experience
Personally, footbath is a happy memory of childhood. Picture a crisp winter night. Wind howling outside. In contrast, on the inside, cozy yellow light filled the living room. There was some warm tea in hand and the TV was on. My grandparents, in their 70s, and the then little me would all soak our feet in warm water in separate buckets. I would be preoccupied by some cartoon series on TV. My grandma would be sewing something. And my grandpa, like I mentioned previously, would slowly doze off. Sometimes, because of the relaxation nature of a footbath, I would find myself zoning out during the process, which makes it a meditative experience.
Expert's opinion
"Footbath can relieve tense feet, help to relax muscles, even relieve pain, and provide a sense of comfort. It also encourages blood circulation by increasing blood supply to the feet, thus improving the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to that area, while helping to remove toxins," said Chinese medicine doctor Liu.
Another benefit is to potentially help in releasing stress and anxiety in everyday life. This is because our feet are linked to the rest of the body. By stimulating acupoints on our feet, it provides overall relaxation and psychological relief.
- Xin Liu, a Chinese medicine doctor living in Dubai.
"Another benefit is to potentially help in releasing stress and anxiety in everyday life. This is because our feet are linked to the rest of the body. By stimulating acupoints on our feet, it provides overall relaxation and psychological relief."
Several research studies online revealed that a warm footbath improves sleep quality and shortens sleep latency. Liu echoed this finding, "Relaxing the feet and improving blood circulation may help in improving sleep quality. A footbath can be done before bed to prepare you for a better night's sleep.
"Overall in Chinese medicine, foot soaking is considered a therapy that promotes general health."
How to do a footbath at home
You can use a bucket, deep and wide enough to soak your feet fully in water. Liu suggests that the water temperature should be slightly higher than your body temperature - it cannot be too hot. You should soak your feet for 15 to 30 minutes, during which time, if the water cools down, you can add more warm water in, to increase the temperature.
Who should not do a footbath
"If you have any skin conditions on your feet or your feet have open wounds, ulcers, burns or infections, you should avoid soaking your feet in warm water," Liu suggested.
People with severe heart disease or abnormally high blood pressure should avoid a warm footbath. "High water temperature when soaking feet may cause blood vessels to dilate and increase the burden on your heart."
People with severe blood circulation problems, vasospasm or blood coagulation disorders should not do it either. "Soaking feet in warm water may affect your blood circulation conditions.
"In the early stages of pregnancy, you should also avoid using overheated water to soak your feet," Liu added on the list. "In the state of fever, cold or inflammation, soaking feet in warm water may aggravate the loss of body heat, which is not conducive to recovery. So it should be avoided.
"In general, if you have a medical condition, it's best to consult your doctor or professional healthcare provider to ensure safe and appropriate foot soaking."

Sciatica: How to cure this excruciating back pain?
: Mathew, Biju. 
: Modern to alternative medicines, all you need to know about treating sciatica A searing pain down the back of the leg is usually a sign of sciatica. Life with sciatica is troublesome: simple acts like sitting or picking something off the floor can be excruciating. Here's an explainer that includes accounts from people who suffered from sciatica, and treatment options: Modern Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Indian traditional medicine Ayurveda, and Homeopathy.
'My battles with spinal problems'
A shaft of pain shot through my left leg. It was like a burning sensation down the back of the thigh. Scary, indeed. That was around 15 years ago, my first bout with sciatica.
A trip to an orthopedic expert followed. The doctor attributed it to prolonged sitting at the desk and poor posture. An Xray followed by a course of anti-inflammatory medicines were only a prelude to physiotherapy sessions. They helped, and the pain went away as I continued to do the exercises prescribed by the physiotherapist.
A few years later, the pain was back. I knew the reason: my unhealthy desk routine and worse, I ignored the exercise. The regimen was repeated and there was relief. And it hasn't been back. Yoga helped especially surya namaskaram, or the sun salutation.
Now I am back with the same doctor. My lumbar region is fine, but the cervical area is sore and painful. Long hours hunched over the computer followed by some more poring over the cellphone made matters worse.
I ignored it and went swimming and played badminton. A pinched nerve was the result. It was excruciating to lie on my back and two fingers became numb. Disc degeneration is the cause, the doctor said, adding that the space between some vertebrae has been reduced drastically.
Sciatica is no longer a worry, but I'm battling cervicalgia.
— Shyam A Krishna, Senior Associate Editor
'The excruciating pain radiated down my leg and consumed every aspect of my life'
It all began with a twinge in my lower back, an innocent whisper of discomfort that soon transformed into a spasm — that would come and go. Simple tasks like bending down or sitting for more than a few minutes became challenges. The pain was unrelenting at times as if my body was waging a war against itself.
Yet there were days when I was completely fine. The doctors said I suffered from a compressed disc. It was the pressure from my herniated disc that irritated the sciatic nerve, causing pain.
The excruciating pain radiated down my leg and consumed every aspect of my life. Sometimes I would wake up in the morning with a stiff back. Sciatica had become an unwelcome companion, casting a shadow over my life.
The intensity of the pain ranged from mild to severe, and it worsened with certain activities like sitting, standing, or walking.
However, little did I know that within the depths of despair, I would find the resilience to triumph over this debilitating condition. I refused to let it define me.
An appropriate treatment plan and proper guidance on exercises helped. Physical therapy and exercises to strengthen the core became my sanctuary — a place where pain and hope intertwined.
With each workout session, I pushed myself beyond my perceived limitations. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I emerged on the other side. The pain that had once defined me had been reduced to a mere memory.
— Sadiq Shaban, Opinion Editor
What is sciatica?
Sciatica refers to the pain that originates in the lower back, goes into the buttock and travels down the leg. It can also manifest as weakness, numbness, or tingling in the leg. It is caused by irritation or injury to the sciatic nerve or pressure on it.
How modern medicine diagnoses and treats sciatica
"A Dubai-based taxi driver approached me for sciatica treatment. To diagnose the condition, we asked him to walk on the toe or heel and asked him to rise from a squatting position, which was extremely difficult for the patient," said Dr Amit Kumar Krishna, Specialist Orthopedics Surgeon, Aster Hospital, Dubai. Lifting the affected leg while lying down will worsen the sciatica pain, said the Dubai-based orthopedic surgeon.
Sciatica treatment
Anti-inflammatories, corticosteroids, lumbosacral belt, strict bed rest, and physiotherapy are the regular treatment methods, but in some cases, steroid injection around the impinged nerve is required, said Dr Amit Kumar. "If the initial treatments fail and symptoms persist or get aggravated even after six weeks, the patient may need surgery."
How effective is the sacroiliac belt in treating sciatica?
The sacroiliac belt is very helpful in the initial three weeks of conservative treatment as it helps in the mobility of the patient and during the patient's daily activities, it also restricts movement like forward bending and an abnormal twist of the spine, which may aggravate the symptoms, said Dr Amit Kumar.
How Chinese medicine treats sciatica
According to Chinese medicine, sciatica is typically seen as an imbalance or blockage of Qi (vital energy) and blood flow in the meridians of the body, said Dr Liu Xin, Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner, Wellth, Dubai.
To treat sciatica, Chinese medicine aims to restore the balance of Qi and blood, promote circulation, and alleviate pain, said Dr Liu Xin.
Chinese medicine, which includes various traditional practices such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, cupping Tuina massage, and traditional exercise like taiji, approaches sciatica from a holistic perspective.
The first choice of treatment is acupuncture
Acupuncture points are believed to be located along meridians and can help regulate the flow of Qi and blood; by stimulating these points, acupuncture aims to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and restore the balance of energy in the body, explained Dr Liu Xin.
"The frequency of acupuncture sessions can vary depending on your specific health condition and the recommendations of your acupuncturist. In general, it is common for individuals to start with more frequent sessions and then gradually decrease the frequency as their condition improves. Typically, weekly 2 or 3 sessions are recommended initially, and then the frequency may be reduced to weekly or biweekly or monthly visits as the desired results are achieved," Dr Liu Xin said.
This is how Ayurveda treats sciatica
Sciatica, one of the most excruciating and irritating nerve pain, is a common health problem encountered by Ayurveda practitioners, said Dr V L Shyam, Medical Director, Shyam's Ayurveda Centre, UAE.
Ayurveda comes with the experience of treating Sciatica for over 2,500 years. The condition was identified and recorded in 700 BC by Sushrutha (father of Surgery as per Ayurveda texts) and he named it Gridhrasi . The word Gridhrasi itself suggests that the gait of the patient is similar to a Gridhra (vulture) — whose body is bent towards one side while walking, and abnormal throwing action is seen in the affected leg. Another meaning of Gridhrasi is the deep piercing and pulling pain as if a 'vulture eating flesh with its beak', explained Dr Shyam, quoting ancient Ayurveda texts.
Ayurveda elaborates on two types of sciatica: Vata-dominated and Vata-Kapha dominated. The classical signs and symptoms of Gridhrasi mentioned by Ayurveda are pain, intermittent pricking sensation, stiffness and rigidity; twitching or pulsating pain, numbness and sensory loss felt in areas: low back, waist, buttocks, thigh, knee, calf and foot, the alternative medicine doctor said.
In the Vata-Kapha type of sciatica, loss of taste, reduced strength in the affected leg and heaviness of legs are seen. The treatment is slightly different in each type, he explained.
What are the recommendations of Ayurveda to tackle sciatica?
Ayurveda book Ashtanga Hrudaya (written in 700AD) mentions that the lifting of the leg is restricted in Gridhrasi . Restricted "straight leg raising (SLR)" is considered as the clinical confirmation of sciatica, he added.
Ayurveda recommends reducing dry foods, lentils and dals, cold food, spicy-bitter-astringent foods, untimely eating, dieting and fasting, overexertion, keeping awake at night, suppression of urges, uncomfortable posture while sleeping, and reducing emotions like stress, grief, fear and anger, Dr Shyam said.
Ayurveda recommends natural medicines to reduce sciatic nerve inflammation and nerve tonics and also advocates a few heat therapies and oil treatments for the relief of sciatic pains. Administration of medicines through the anal tract (Vasthy) and thermo-cautery (superficial burns with heated metallic equipment) are other extensive treatment methods mentioned by Ayurveda for sciatica, Dr Shyam said.

How Homeopathy treats sciatica
Homeopathy is a system of medicine that treats patients on symptom similarity. To treat the patient: symptom presentations, disease history, family history and when and how often the pain worsens are all taken into consideration, said Dr Rosamma Sabu, Balsam Homeopathic Centre, Sharjah. After all of these are considered, a specific remedy will be selected for the patient, she said.
Homeopathy gives importance to patients' tastes
"I remember a patient with left leg pain that increased while lying down at night and was better by walking. The pain was so severe that he couldn't sleep at night and must walk up and down frequently. He was also diabetic, and whenever he woke up at night, he used to drink cold milk. He could not explain the reason, but it was one of his favourite drinks," said the Sharjah-based Homeopath.
Homeopathy is a system of medicine that treats patients on symptom similarity.
- Dr Rosamma Sabu
Homeopathy gives importance to the tastes of the patient, and taking all aspects into consideration a treatment plan was selected and given for 15 days, Dr Rosamma said.
The patient returned on the 15th day complaining that the pain remained the same, but his sleep quality was much better. The same medicine was repeated for a month, and he came back after six months and said that the pain reappeared in winter. The medications were continued for another month and he never had the same problem again, the Homeopath said.
Here is all you need to know about sciatica
What's the sciatic nerve?
The sciatic nerve is the largest single nerve in the human body. Formed of five nerve roots in the lumbar and sacral spine, the sciatic nerve starts in the lower back and runs down the back of each leg.
The body has two sciatic nerves, one on each side — the right and left legs. The nerve controls the muscles on the back of the knee and lower leg. It also provides sensation to the back of the thigh, the outer and back part of the lower leg, and the sole, according to a report on the US-based Cleveland Clinic's website.
What are the types of sciatica?
There are two types of sciatica: true sciatica and sciatica-like conditions. True sciatica is the pressure or injury that directly affects your sciatic nerve. Sciatica-like conditions feel like sciatica, but it does not result from an injury or pressure to the sciatic nerve. Other reasons could be linked to the sciatic nerve or its five roots.
What are the symptoms of sciatica?
The symptoms of sciatica vary widely. Generally, it may feel like a dull ache or burning sensation in the back, running down the buttock to the back of the thigh and the calf. It can also feel like an electric shock. Some people experience mild tingling, weakness or numbness in the leg or hip.
The symptoms can be infrequent in some cases, while there are cases when they can be so severe and debilitating that a person cannot move. It mostly occurs on only one side of the body.
The pain starts slowly and may worsen after standing or sitting. If sciatica stems from a compressed disc, patients will feel pain while sneezing, coughing or laughing. In other cases, pain occurs while bending backwards or walking. It may happen when straining or holding your breath.
How is sciatica diagnosed?
Healthcare providers use a combination of methods to diagnose sciatica. Generally, the symptoms give a fair idea. A report in Penn Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania says, besides flexibility and strength checks, they will also conduct a physical examination to find out the following:
- Visible changes in walking
- Weakness when bending the knee
- Difficulty bending the foot inwards or down
- Difficulty walking on toes
- Difficulty bending forward or backward
- Abnormal or weak reflexes
- Loss of sensation or numbness
- Pain when lifting the leg straight up while lying on the back
What are the tests to diagnose sciatica?
Several tests can help in diagnosing sciatica and ruling out similar conditions. The most common tests include:
- X-rays or computed tomography (CT) scans
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans tests of the spine
- Nerve conduction velocity studies
- Electromyography: It measures muscle response to a nerve's stimulation
- Myelogram: A diagnostic imaging test used to look for problems in the spinal canal
How common is sciatica?
Sciatica is a very common condition. About 40 per cent of people experience some form of sciatica, according to the Harvard Medical School. Although it rarely happens before age 20, it becomes more frequent as people age. Men between 30 and 50 are more likely to have sciatica.
About 85 per cent of the population will suffer from back pain at some point in their life, but only between two and 10 per cent will have true sciatica, Canadian chiropractor James Lemieux said on the University of Alberta website.
"People who suffer from acute or chronic back pain tend to be more susceptible to sciatica," Jeffrey N. Katz, professor of medicine and orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School, said. "Your risk also rises if you're obese, if you smoke, or if you're sedentary."
What causes sciatica?
Sciatica occurs when there is pressure on the sciatic nerve. It could also result in an injury. The common causes are:
Slipped or herniated disc: When the soft tissue between the bones (vertebrae) in your spine seeps out
Spinal stenosis: Narrowing of the part of your spine where nerves pass through
Spondylolisthesis: When one of the vertebrae (bones in your spine) slips out of position
Back or pelvic injury
Piriformis syndrome: A pain disorder involving the narrow muscle in the buttocks
Tumours, cysts or other growths
Osteoarthritis
Pregnancy
What are the major risk factors for sciatica?
Some of the many potential risk factors listed by the Cleveland Clinic include:
Injury: Injuries to the spine or lower back increase the risk of developing sciatica.
Wear-and-tear: As people grow old, normal wear-and-tear on the spine can lead to pinched nerves, herniated discs and other conditions that can cause sciatica.
Obesity: A big belly or paunch can weaken the muscles in the back, leading to back strains, pain and other issues.
Insufficient core strength: The strength of the "core" (muscles of your back and abdomen) is vital as abdominal muscles anchor the back muscles.
Jobs: Works that involve heavy lifting, a lot of bending, or working in awkward or unusual positions may increase the risk of back problems. Prolonged sitting without proper back support may also increase your risk.
Posture: Good posture and proper form are important when lifting heavy objects, weight lifting, strength training or similar activities. Or else it can lead to back problems.
Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes increases your risk of peripheral neuropathy. That damages your nerves, including any of the sciatica nerves causing or contributing to sciatica.
Physical inactivity: Prolonged sitting and a lack of physical activity can increase the risk of sciatica.
Tobacco: Nicotine use can affect circulation and raise the risk of chronic pain, including sciatica.
What are the complications of sciatica?
Most people recover from sciatica within four weeks of treatment. In some cases, it may extend to a year.
A possible complication of sciatica is chronic or long-term pain, which results from unrelieved nerve compression. The main complications, according to the Health Encyclopaedia of the University of Rochester Merical Centre in the US, are:
1. Increased pain
2. A slipped or herniated disc
3. Loss of feeling or weakness in your affected leg
4. Loss of bowel or bladder function: Surgery will be necessary.
5. Permanent nerve damage: It could lead to chronic muscle weakness, such as a "drop foot," making walking difficult or even impossible.
How is sciatica treated?
No treatment is required in mild cases, and recovery occurs over time. Bed rest is NOT recommended. Start mild exercises after the pain dissipates. But continued pain will require treatment, depending on the severity of the condition.
Self-treatment
In cases of mild pain, self-treatment can be helpful. If the pain doesn't go away, seek professional help. These are some self-help tips from the Harvard Medical School:
1. Reduce physical activity for the first few days before resuming them slowly.
2. Avoid lifting heavy objects, and do not twist the back.
3. Ice or heat packs: They can help reduce pain and swelling during the first few days of pain. Apply ice packs (wrapped in a towel) for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. After the first several days, switch to a heating pad or warm compress. Apply heat for 20 minutes at a time.
4. Physical activity: This is best learnt from a physiotherapist or a sports medicine expert. It will strengthen core muscles.
5. Seek professional help: If the self-care doesn't help after a few weeks, it's time to consult a doctor.
Regular treatments
Prescription medications: Painkillers, muscle relaxants and other medications may help relieve sciatica symptoms.
Physiotherapy: A physiotherapist will ask the patient to do exercises to reduce pressure on the sciatic nerve. Stretching exercises, walking, swimming and water aerobics will also help.
Spinal injections: Injections like corticosteroids may provide short-term relief (typically up to three months). But this is no substitute for therapies that give long-term relief.
Alternative therapies: A chiropractor to adjust the spine, yoga, acupuncture and massage therapy might also help.
Surgery
Surgery to relieve the compression of spinal nerves is an option when sciatica is very severe. It is usually a last resort when all other treatments fail.
Doctors recommend surgery only if the pain that prevents a person from carrying out their normal routine. Particularly if the patient has symptoms of nerve damage or a possibility of nerve injury. A Mayo Clinic report said people with severe leg weakness or bowel or bladder changes might need surgery.
Surgery options, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine, include:
Discectomy: It is to remove fragments or small sections of a herniated disk that are pressing on a nerve.
Laminectomy: Behind each vertebra is a section called the lamina. A laminectomy removes a section of the lamina that's pressing the spinal nerves.
Is sciatica preventable?
Some causes of sciatica can be prevented, but it can also happen for unknown reasons, according to a Cleveland Clinic report. Anything that reduces the risk of nerve damage can only be good. That includes avoiding sitting for long hours or doing anything that puts pressure on the buttocks.
Here are some tips from the Cleveland Clinic to reduce the risk of sciatica:
Good posture: Maintain a good posture while sitting, standing and sleeping. Use a good technique (bend the knees) while lifting heavy objects to reduce stress on the back.
Avoid tobacco: Nicotine from smoking or vaping reduces the blood supply to your bones, weakening the spine and its components.
Body weight: Maintain a healthy weight by eating nutritious food. Calcium and vitamin D are good for bone health.
Physical activity: That should include stretching and strength training. Increasing core strength and flexibility is good for back pain. Aerobic exercises can also help maintain a healthy weight.
Managing sciatica is all about pursuing a healthy lifestyle. Physical activity and strengthening core muscles are key to a pain-free life. So, get moving.

A bottle of hot water, anyone? The truth behind drinking hot water explained
: Zhang, Xuena. 
: Hot water as part of the diet has immense value in China, Japan and India Dubai: At the beginning of November, 2022, Japan's food and beverage giant Asahi introduced bottled hot water to the public.
The 50 to 60 degrees Celsius drink is sold in 340ml plastic bottles at 105JPY (Dh2.86) or 113JPY (Dh3.07) depending on the store, according to the reporter Touka Nagase at Time Out Tokyo.
Increasing demand for hot water in Japan
Asahi stated on PR Times, that it decided to launch the product due to the increasing demand for plain hot water in Japan, and the fact that many customers have pointed out the unavailability of it in convenience stores, when they need one.
It says that the percentage of Japanese people who drink plain hot water, has been increasing yearly, from 11.8 per cent in 2009 to 61.0 per cent in 2022.
In their survey, participants reported the craving of plain hot water on frigid late autumn or winter mornings, as an alternative to caffeine-contained hot beverages, such as coffee and tea - the drink serves the purpose of warming consumers up without the jittery caffeine effects.
Upon launching, it stirred polar opinions on social media in Japan. According to an article on Sora News 24, online reactions are generally positive, but it's not everyone's cup of tea.
Depending on where you are from, you might be confused and have some questions over the need for hot water. However, Japan might not be your country to ask questions - China is.
China and its billions of thermoses
The nation's fixation on hot water is hard to miss - it's served virtually everywhere you go in China, throughout all seasons, including simmering summers.
Hot water dispensers are conveniently distributed at public transportation facilities, and in front of them, there is always a queue of people with a thermos clutched in their hands.
Many foreign visitors to China share the same confusion - they are served hot water at restaurants. Though they can ask for cold water, not all restaurants can fulfil their requests - particularly in winter, cold drinks are not always available, as some restaurants are not customised for this unpopular request.
In fact, hot water is even served to thousands of delegates at national level conferences. As Nicole Liu from Los Angeles Times describes, "Brigades of young women… are toting thermoses around the massive building all day, pouring drinks for delegates. Some use the steaming hot liquid to make tea… but many others simply drink it straight."
Liu also shared her conversation with a Lebanese flight attendant from a UAE-based airline, who learnt very quickly what Chinese passengers need on a flight. "One big difference between Chinese tourists and non-Chinese is that you'll be called for 're shui' or hot water in Chinese," said the flight attendant.
So, why the national enthusiasm for hot water in China?
This is the question that many foreign visitors to China ask.
Apart from 'warming up' one's body on a crisp winter morning, and 'an alternative to caffeine-contained hot beverages', there is much more in China's habit of sipping on 're shui'.
Although there is no confirmed answer on when Chinese people started drinking hot water, an article written by blogger Chao Mo Jun on Tencent's news channel - new.qq.com, stated that the scale marks found on the inside of early potteries (roughly from 2500 to 3500 BC), and scorch marks at the bottom of them, indicate the possibility of early human habit of drinking boiled water, in nowadays Shandong province in China.
Chinese medicine
"Huangdi Neijing, an ancient Chinese medical book says, 'When healthy qi [energy] exists inside, evil cannot interfere with your body.' Paying attention to heat preservation within your body can help maintain your immunity. Drinking hot water, minimising the consumption of cold or raw food and allowing your body to rest will help you preserve qi, " Peng Gao, Chinese medicine doctor from the Dubai-based traditional Chinese medical clinic Tong Ren Tang, told Gulf News.
What is 'qi'? According to vocabulary.com, in Chinese philosophy, qi, is the life force that every person and thing has - it stands for the energy in everything. Chinese medicine and acupuncture both address the concept. The 38-year-old doctor said, "As the Chinese proverb says - 'Tens of thousands of diseases rise from the cold.' It's important to keep warm. Our body's source of energy is food. If you mix food with cold water, the spleen and stomach may be harmed due to the extreme change in temperature and become weak - making absorption of nutrients difficult.
"On the contrary, drinking hot water will keep the spleen and stomach warm and elevate your body's energy."
Hot water cannot be consumed if it's scalding hot, it should be cooled till the temperature is slightly higher than your body temperature, so that you feel a warm sensation when drinking it.
- Peng Gao, Chinese medicine doctor from the Dubai-based traditional Chinese medical clinic Tong Ren Tang
Gao specifically said that the common cold virus infection is prone to aggravate in a cold environment, leading to a series of diseases - in this case, keeping your body warm by drinking hot water, will help you fight the virus a great deal.
He also suggested that hot water cannot be consumed if it's scalding hot, it should be cooled till the temperature is slightly higher than your body temperature, so that you feel a warm sensation when drinking it.
The legend of hot water in China
Several online reports mentioned the legend of how the habit of drinking hot water kept southern Chinese protected from the cholera epidemic in 1862, which originally broke out in Shanghai, then spread northward.
It's said that southern Chinese at the time drank more hot water than northern Chinese. Boiling water would have removed contaminants, as cholera spreads through contaminated water and food. Finally the reason of cholera's northward travel proved to be through merchant ships and drinking hot water certainly became more popular following that.
High temperature in boiling water kills certain bad microorganisms. It is more hygienic to drink, especially if the water source is not filtered and disinfected properly.
Nation-wide promotion
Again, according to several online reports, drinking boiled water was promoted by the Chinese government in the 1930s, as one of its essentials in the 'New Life Movement', to protect people from infectious diseases, especially those transmitted through water sources.
Later, in the 1950s, the consumption of boiled water was addressed again during the national health campaign, which centred around four topics: public environmental sanitation, control of disease-causing biological vectors such as insects, popularisation of health knowledge, and the strengthening of health organisations.
It's said that during this period, hot water suppliers slowly became available in public areas - due to the scarcity of energy source used to boil water, not every individual had the means or could afford boiling water at home.
In Shanghai and surrounding regions, these suppliers were called 'laohu zao' (tiger stove) - the name was based on the shape of the stove.
'Tiger stove' or hot water suppliers selling boiled water at a price, have nearly disappeared nowadays. Though every household could easily boil water at home, hot water dispensers are still all round in public places in case someone wants to fill their empty thermos.
Younger generation's attitude towards hot water in China
The historical and medical influence on hot water consumption, has continued even now. It's not rare to see a Chinese person in their 30s, or even 20s, walking around with hot water bottles. However, their attachment to hot water is certainly not as strong as the past generations.
With easy accessibility to international food and beverages in Chinese cities, the younger generation's taste buds became more 'adaptive'. Some might even distance themselves from hot water deliberately, and label it as "old fashioned". Cold beverages are commonly ordered by them, especially in the sweltering heat of a summer day - however, while they enjoy a cold can of soda, their older relatives will likely be on the side, lecturing them on how harmful it is.
Warm water drinking habit in southern India
In her 2018 article on New Delhi Television (NDTV)'s exclusive website for food, writer Sushmita Sengupta explained southern India's love for warm water, during and after meals, even when the heat could potentially 'melt the toughest of skins'.
"One of the best benefits of drinking hot water with meals is said to be its impact on digestion. The practice is believed to be tied with ancient Ayurvedic teachings," she wrote.
"According to Ayurneda, doing so (drinking chilled water) can disturb the normal functioning of the gastric juices and also upset the balance of doshas [energy]. Experts claim that chilled water … contract your blood vessels, thereby, restricting digestion.
"On the other hand, drinking lukewarm water makes the process of digestion less cumbersome for the body … Lukewarm water also facilitates better elimination of toxins, stimulate hunger, soothe throat, cleanse bladder," she further explained.
What is Ayurveda and dosha? According to physician and scholar from the Netherlands, Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld's 1999 publication, A History of Indian Medical Literature, ayurveda is a very ancient system of alternative medicine with roots in the Indian subcontinent. It's said to be commonly practised in India and Nepal, with varied therapies including herbal medicines, yoga, laxatives, special diets, meditation, enemas and medical oils, according to online reports.
As per Oxford Languages, in Ayurvedic medicine, dosha comprises three energies that circulate in the body, and govern physiological activity. Their differing proportions determine individual temperament and physical constitution. When unbalanced, it will cause a disposition toward particular physical and mental disorders.

China: Traditional Uyghur medicine used to treat COVID patients, with positive results
: As COVID cases surge in China's western Xinjiang region, the area's top government official has urged hospitals to incorporate traditional Uyghur medicine to treat patients - a rare acknowledgement of treatment that blends ancient Greco-Roman, Egyptian, Arabian and Indian medicine dating back more than 2,500 years.
Ma Xingrui, Communist Party Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, said during a Jan. 4 video conference that health officials and hospitals must take advantage of traditional Chinese and Uyghur treatments as well as Western drugs to fight the coronavirus, which has spread after authorities relaxed stringent anti-viral restrictions after nationwide protests in late November.
Using plant-based ingredients, traditional Uyghur medicine has been used to treat a wide variety of ailments, including skin disease, urogenital disease, rheumatism, digestive problems and respiratory infections in the form of pills, tablets, tinctures, granules, syrups and liniments.
Traditional Uyghur medicines specifically used to combat coronavirus symptoms include Zukam Jewhiri, a cold remedy, and Sherbiti Zufa, a syrup whose main ingredient is hyssop, an aromatic, semi-evergreen,shrubby perennial belonging to the mint family.
Health workers are reporting positive results.
Ethnic medicine in Xinjiang has been showing its advantage [by] contributing to controlling COVID and to the treatment of COVID patients, said a physician at Aksu City Hospital who did not give her name because she was not authorized to speak to the media.
We treated severely ill COVID patients by continuously giving them Uyghur medicine for three days, which lowered their fevers, the doctor said. There are cases in which patients recovered from COVID because of Uyghur medicine.
Ma's comments were made the same day that China's National Health Commission issued a paper on developing and promoting the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine against the COVID-19 virus and its variants, although it made no specific mention of traditional Uyghur medicine.
This measure aims to reduce the deterioration of the patient situation, China's official Xinhua news agency reported. Local organizations employ Chinese medicine and prepare recipes and treat the new COVID patients, reduce the patient's hospital visit and wait times, and increase consultation efficiency.
Pharmaceutical industry
Xinjiang is home to more than 60 pharmaceutical companies, which generated revenue of 8.8 billion yuan, or about U.S.$1.3 million, in 2021, a 10.5% increase from the same period the previous year, according to a report by Tengritagh News Network in January 2022.
Many of the companies' products are based on traditional Uyghur medicine, which has been incorporated into traditional Chinese medicine, though China doesn't acknowledge it, Uyghur sources say.
After the coronavirus broke out in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, many drug companies in Xinjiang operated at full capacity to produce traditional Uyghur pills and syrups to treat COVID patients, China Daily reported in February 2020.
The government's strategy to deploy traditional medicine, which incorporates Uyghur medicine, shows that Uyghur treatments are an invaluable medical asset, said Uyghur medical professional Mutellip Emchi.
The recent attention the Chinese government has given to investing in and developing traditional medicine is due to being unable to find a cure, he said, referring to the coronavirus.
China and the international community realized and acknowledged the effectiveness of Uyghur traditional medicine against the COVID virus, he said.
Rising numbers
Hospitals in Xinjiang have seen a surge in the number of COVID patients operated by the government or by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a state-owned economic and paramilitary organization, said a Chinese nurse at one of the hospitals in Aksu prefecture.
The nurse, who did not provide her name because she was not authorized to speak to the press, said she could not disclose the number of hospital's coronavirus patient numbers.
But she did say that using locally produced Uyghur medicine for COVID patients helped prevent their deterioration and reduced fever and coughing.
However, the government's instructions to incorporate the use of traditional Uyghur medicine has raised concern among traditional Uyghur medicine experts.
Mutellip Emchi, chair of the Uyghur Medicine Professionals Association, who has been living in Turkey since 2016, said the Chinese have plundered Uyghur medical resources and industrialized them for their own interests.
Flu pills and powders
For example, the Chinese manufacture flu-curing pills and powders based on traditional Uyghur recipes, though they have not made any progress in the field, Emchi said.
With the spread of the coronavirus, pharmaceutical companies that manufacture flu pills in Urumqi, Kashgar and Hotan could not make enough of them, he said. We knew it by reading news on social media.
These medicines have been used to treat lung infections, respiratory diseases, asthma, and lung and heart diseases, he added.
Because the coronavirus attacks patients' lungs, the hospitals use these Uyghur medicines to treat COVID patients, Emchi said. When there was a shortage of medicine in the hospitals, our Uyghur medicine effectively treated COVID patients of all ethnic origins.
Uyghur medical professionals in Turkey, who have formed formed a volunteer group and developed a unique recipe for treating COVID patients using ingredients sourced locally, say they have seen positive results in patients treated with traditional Uyghur recipes, he said.
We produced medicine and distributed it among Uyghurs in Turkey, Central Asia and other parts of the world, and local Turkish people and Arab people who have heard about our medicine started using it, he said.
With news of our medicine's effectiveness spread by word of mouth, many more people are coming to us for these medicines, Emchi added.
Meanwhile, medical staff at hospitals in Urumqi said the COVID situation is getting worse in Xinjiang, with more infected patients and not enough beds.
A Uyghur based in the United States, who declined to be named so as to not jeopardize relatives still living in Xinjiang, told RFA that the number of deaths from COVID has increased. His younger sister and her daughter have been infected, he said.
The number of deaths among the infected people in our homeland is severe, he said, and everyone has been infected, including children in the kindergarten.

China: Asia Fact Check Lab: Can 'magical remedies' cure COVID?
: In brief
China's abrupt relaxation of its zero-COVID policy has contributed to a broad wave of infections that is overwhelming China's healthcare systems and triggering a shortage of over-the-counter medicines. Amid a rush by Chinese to stock their medicine cabinets, social media and some merchants are touting magical cures for COVID, from canned peaches, baijiu alcohol, and garlic to controversial traditional Chinese medicines, such as Lianhua Qingwen Capsules.
Asia Fact Check Lab (AFCL) found no scientific evidence that these popular products can cure patients with COVID. In fact, public health experts warn that while people may turn to unproven remedies when faced with a lack of medical supplies or clear communications from authorities, relying on such cures could provide a false sense of security and prevent the sick from getting proper care.
In depth
China began easing some of its zero-COVID restrictions in November 2022, after protests broke out in several major cities over stringent government lockdowns and other containment policies. In early December, the government phased out mass testing in large cities and removed mandatory travel restrictions.
Since then, official daily infection rates as reported by China's National Health Commission (NHC) have fallen sharply, to several thousand nationwide. But social media and other reports suggest a rapid spread of the virus, with many Chinese on the internet reporting large increases in the number of COVID cases in their neighborhoods. Users have also posted pictures of long queues at hospitals and empty pharmacy shelves for over-the-counter medicines.
The websites of 1 Drug and Ali Health Pharmacy, two of China's largest online pharmacies, showed that common over-the-counter treatments for colds, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, vitamin C, and popular traditional Chinese medicines, are all out of stock, according to a check by AFCL.
Peaches, garlic and alcoholic spirits
In the meantime, many magical cures and folklore remedies have popped up in online discussion forums. These include:
Canned peaches: Influencers on popular social media websites have recommended canned peaches as a remedy to relieve COVID symptoms, causing several brands of the canned fruit to quickly sell out.
Electrolyte water: After discussions started trending online about how electrolyte water could help cure COVID, Internet searches for homemade electrolyte water recipes surged, with frequently recommended ingredients including lemon, salt water, and a pinch of green tea.
Garlic: Citing traditional literature describing how garlic was used to treat patients during epidemics in ancient China, a retired traditional medicine practitioner announced that he had invented the Garlic Breathing Method. This method purportedly gives users a way to inhale allicin, a compound found in garlic which the practitioner alleged can cure all coronaviruses, including COVID.
Salt and vinegar: From the beginning of the pandemic, many people have subscribed to gargling with salt water and sanitizing rooms with steam from boiling vinegar as a way to prevent and treat COVID. These folklore remedies continue to be popular during the latest surge.
Baijiu: A widely circulated post cites a doctor at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital who recommends drinking two shots of baijiu, a spirit usually containing 35 percent to 60 percent alcohol content, daily to prevent getting COVID. A proposal by China's baijiu trade association to research the potential use of baijiu to treat COVID was a trendy topic in 2020, near the start of the pandemic.
Some of these approaches may have health benefits. For example, studies have shown that eating raw garlic could potentially reduce inflammation and boost the immune system. But generally, news media, medical professionals, and even some manufacturers of cures-including one company that produces a popular brand of canned peaches-have expressed disapproval over using these folk remedies for treating COVID. AFCL has concluded after consulting with healthcare professionals that none of the remedies listed above has any antiviral effects. Furthermore, excessive consumption of alcohol can cause liver damage and even poisoning.
Government-backed traditional medicines
Throughout the pandemic, critics have raised concerns over the inclusion of Lianhua Qingwen Capsules-a patented traditional Chinese medicine which has not undergone clinical trials-in the list of government-approved COVID treatments. Health authorities and high-profile medical experts such as Zhong Nanshan, who is often called the Dr. Fauci of China, have endorsed the capsules for treating COVID.
Manufacturer Shijiazhuang Yiling Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd has also released a series of spin-off products such as masks and mints that incorporate Lianhua Qingwen. The company's stock prices have surged during the recent outbreak, rising more than 20% in the first week of December.
However, no large-scale clinical studies have taken place to show that Lianhua Qingwen or its spin-off products can prevent or treat COVID, Dong-Yan Jin, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, has said to the media. At best, the capsules can relieve some COVID symptoms, but they are not recommended for severe COVID patients, he said.
Findings from a small-scale study recently published in the American Journal of Translational Research showed that early-stage COVID patients who took Lianhua Qingwen Capsules saw symptoms disappear more quickly and were released from hospital earlier compared to a group of control patients. However, the capsule has not been recommended for treating COVID outside China, and it has been banned by some countries such as Australia, where ephedrine, an ingredient in Lianhua Qingwen, is regulated as a controlled substance. The U.S. prohibits the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids due to serious safety risks, including association with heart attacks.
Several front-line doctors speaking to AFCL said Lianhua Qingwen's active ingredients such as ephedrine may help to relieve some COVID symptoms. But they emphasized that the drug itself, like canned peaches and garlic, cannot cure the disease. As with other medications, patients should only take traditional Chinese medicine under the supervision of a healthcare provider.
Face masks and mints that incorporate Lianhua Qingwen are unlikely to prove more effective than normal products in keeping COVID or COVID symptoms at bay, the doctors said.
Why Chinese seek 'magical remedies'
Three years into the pandemic, the World Health Organization and health officials in different countries have established protocols for treating COVID. In China, the widespread circulation of misinformation about magical drugs and folk remedies underscores both people's fears about COVID and the country's lack of preparedness to handle widescale outbreaks.
Other countries have also grappled with disinformation about COVID treatments. In the U.S., many people and even former President Trump had advocated the use of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that's been widely shown as ineffective as a COVID treatment.
A senior Chinese health expert who works with Chinese health authorities attributed the current chaotic situation in China to false propaganda on the deadliness of COVID and to the improper distribution of medical resources in the past three years.
The expert, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons, said in an interview that China has spent enormous resources on mass testing, lockdowns, and isolation of infected people, but didn't use this period to update its healthcare system to prepare for potential major outbreaks. Now many people with symptoms can't access essential medicine and health services, so they are resorting to magical remedies.
In addition, the government's previous stringent zero-COVID policies and messaging emphasizing the dangers of COVID have placed a heavy psychological burden on the public, the expert said. Even though authorities are now seeking to convey the relative mildness of the current Omicron variant, the public's anxiety can't be dispelled instantly.
The expert added that the popular folk remedies and traditional Chinese medicines currently being promoted as COVID cures are not credible. She suggested that most COVID patients will recover through rest and that they can alleviate their discomfort by taking proven over-the-counter medicines. However, patients who develop serious symptoms should seek medical care.

World News: Herbal Treatments Sell Out Ahead of Expected Infections
: Lin, Liza. 
: SINGAPORE -- Sales of popular traditional Chinese medicine are surging as Chinese buyers rush to stock up on Covid-19 treatments after China announced it would ease its strict pandemic restrictions.
The scramble to secure supplies has reignited a debate among public-health experts about an aggressive push by China's government to promote traditional remedies in the fight against Covid-19, even as it declines to approve wide use of foreign-made mRNA vaccines.
Prices of Lianhua Qingwen, a herbal preparation endorsed by senior health officials as a prophylactic for Covid, have spiked in recent days, prompting the drug's manufacturer to issue a statement committing to price and supply stability. Shares of its parent company, Shijiazhuang Yiling Pharmaceutical Co., also hit a record high this week, with investors speculating demand for its products would surge.
On popular e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s Taobao, some online merchants have limited the sale of Lianhua Qingwen to two boxes per buyer. As stocks online and in stores ran low Friday, China's market regulator issued a statement warning retailers against hoarding and driving up the cost of the remedy and other Covid-relief drugs.
Two pharmacies in Beijing visited by The Wall Street Journal on Friday were sold out of Lianhua Qingwen, and a third was limiting purchases.
The emptying shelves are a testament to how heavily China's government has promoted traditional remedies as a defense against Covid-19 -- a campaign that has delighted advocates of traditional Chinese medicine, worried skeptics and drawn warnings from health regulators elsewhere in the world.
"There is some evidence that traditional Chinese medicine does add some benefit to existing Western medicine, but the evidence is not strong and maybe prone to bias," said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia in England. "So Western medicine has to be the mainstay."
In July 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter to a website selling Lianhua Qingwen as a Covid-19 remedy, pointing to rules outlawing the promotion of products that claim to cure, treat or prevent disease without clinical trials as evidence.
Chinese officials have nevertheless continued to say traditional remedies are vital to the fight against the coronavirus.
"Combining Chinese and Western medicine is very important in order to cure the disease, and both medicines should be given equal emphasis," Guo Yanhong, a director at China's National Health Commission, said in a news briefing Wednesday where the relaxation of zero-tolerance Covid measures was announced.
The government's adherence to that message is set to take on added significance in the coming months with China likely to be swamped by a Covid wave that public-health experts say the country is poorly prepared for.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been the subject of debate for decades. Practitioners of the medicine believe that disease arises from imbalances in the body due to unhealthy factors in one's environment or lifestyle and seek to strengthen the body rather than treat the disease itself, as in Western medicine. Underlying such treatments is the idea that people have "hot" or "cold" constitutions that make them prone to ailments in parts of the body.
Western science, however, has little data to support claims of the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine. Critics say advocates overlook the toxicity of such cures.
Since coming to power in 2012, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has thrown his personal support behind efforts to promote traditional Chinese medicine globally.
The pandemic accelerated and expanded that promotional effort. Since the early days of the Covid outbreak, teams of Chinese health experts have traveled to Zimbabwe, Italy, Cambodia and other countries offering treatment plans that mix Chinese vaccines and traditional remedies.

Approaching Covid Wave Tests China's Embrace of Herbal Remedies; Loosening of zero-tolerance pandemic controls revives debate over government's promotion of traditional Chinese medicine
: Lin, Liza. 
: SINGAPORE—Sales of popular traditional Chinese medicine are surging as Chinese buyers rush to stock up on Covid-19 treatments after China announced it would ease its strict pandemic restrictions .
The scramble to secure supplies has reignited a debate among public-health experts about an aggressive push by China's government to promote traditional remedies in the fight against Covid-19, even as it declines to approve wide use of foreign-made mRNA vaccines .

Underlying such treatments is the idea that people have "hot" or "cold" constitutions that make them prone to ailments in parts of the body.
Western science, however, has little data to support claims of the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine. Critics also say advocates overlook the toxicity of such cures.
Since coming to power in 2012, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has thrown his personal support behind efforts to promote traditional Chinese medicine globally. Under his watch, the government designated development of the industry a national strategic priority and passed a new rule regulating growth of the sector.
The pandemic has accelerated and expanded that promotional effort. Since the early days of the Covid outbreak, teams of Chinese health experts have traveled to Zimbabwe, Italy, Cambodia and other countries offering treatment plans that mix Chinese vaccines and traditional remedies.
China has held more than 110 videoconferences to share the country's experience treating Covid with traditional Chinese medicine with more than 150 countries and regions, according to China's National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, a government body that oversees the promotion and development of the products.
This past January, advocates of traditional Chinese medicine, including an official with China's State Council, met World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to pass him a report about China's use of the treatments to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. A month later, the WHO convened a panel of experts to evaluate the use of Chinese medicine in combating the virus.
The effort is an important part of Mr. Xi's longer-term political effort to increase China's influence in global health governance, according to Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.
"This is tied to China's effort to promote patriotism and soft power," Mr. Huang said. "Even if a lot of the work is wasted, they will spare no effort to promote it."
Political analysts say the same nationalist impulse also appears to be at least partly driving China's rejection of foreign-developed mRNA vaccines , which are generally viewed by health experts as more efficient, for broad use.
This year, as Covid outbreaks roiled Hong Kong and Shanghai, authorities in both cities sent packages to households that included rapid tests, masks and traditional Chinese medicines. China also dispatched traditional Chinese medicine specialists to Hong Kong early in the year to advise the local government on pandemic control.
The list of those promoting traditional treatments extends beyond government officials to medical experts like Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory specialist who has taken on a prominent government advisory role akin to Dr. Anthony Fauci in Washington. Dr. Zhong has said Chinese medicine can repair damaged cells and alleviate symptoms such as coughing and fever.
The drive has propelled the buying of Chinese herbs and medicinal products overseas. Customs data show such exports rising to more than $710 million in the first half of 2022, an increase of more than 20% from the same period a year earlier, according to financial data provider Wind.
Lianhua Qingwen's popularity has also boosted the share price of its parent Yiling Pharmaceutical almost fivefold since the start of 2020.
Drug regulators in Australia, Sweden and Singapore have joined the FDA in warning companies selling Lianhua Qingwen to stop promoting the products as a Covid treatment. In a "What You Need to Know" page on its website, the U.S. National Institutes of Health says no firm conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of Chinese herbal remedies because of poor-quality studies.
In 2021, academic journal Phytomedicine issued a correction to a peer-reviewed study the year before that concluded Lianhua Qingwen helped reduce fever, fatigue and coughing in light to moderate cases of Covid-19. The correction disclosed that one of the people involved in the report's publication was the son-in-law of the founder of the Yiling Pharmaceutical.
After the correction was published, the son-in-law, Dr. Jia Zhenhua, said he had no role in the data acquisition, statistical analysis or writing of the study. Neither Dr. Jia nor Yiling Pharmaceutical responded to requests for comment.
The doubts haven't deterred Dr. Jeda Boughton, a Toronto-based traditional Chinese medicine practitioner of more than 20 years, who said she has treated Covid patients since the beginning of the outbreak using modifications of several herbal formulas.
"When you are using Chinese medicine, you are treating a group of symptoms, such as coughing, runny nose, fatigue, etc.," Dr. Jeda said. "You are not just treating the disease Covid-19, it's not like a Western medicine where you give one pill for one disease."

Drugs – 4 essential reads on how they're made, how they work and how context can make poison a medicine
: Lam, Vivian. 
: Matching drug to target The most effective drugs are, in a sense, the product of good matchmaking – they bind to a specific disease-causing receptor in the body, elicit a desired effect and ideally ignore healthy parts of the body. Because of this, most drugs circulate throughout the body and can bind to unintended sites, potentially causing undesired side effects. [...]thalidomide, a compound that caused birth defects in thousands of infants around the world as a morning sickness drug, found redemption as a cancer treatment. Because drugs inherently have more than one function in the body, repurposing existing drugs can help fill a gap where pharmaceutical companies and other developers cannot or will not. Poison as medicine If so many drugs can have toxic effects in the body, be it through side effects or taking the wrong dose or for the wrong condition, what determines whether a drug is a “medicine” or a “poison”?
: Pandemics and disease outbreaks put a spotlight on the hurdles researchers face to get a drug on the shelves. From finding prospective drug candidates to balancing time and financial pressures with ensuring safety and efficacy, there are many aspects of drug development that determine whether a treatment ever makes it out of the lab.
Broadening the definition of “medicine” and where it can be found, however, could help expand the therapeutic options available for both researchers and patients.
Here are four facets of how drugs are developed and how they work in the body, drawn from stories in The Conversation’s archive.
1. Matching drug to target
The most effective drugs are, in a sense, the product of good matchmaking – they bind to a specific disease-causing receptor in the body, elicit a desired effect and ideally ignore healthy parts of the body.
Drugs travel through the bloodstream to reach their targets. Because of this, most drugs circulate throughout the body and can bind to unintended sites, potentially causing undesired side effects.
Researchers can increase the precision and effectiveness of a drug by designing different ways to take it. An inhaler, for example, delivers a drug directly to the lungs without its having to travel through the rest of the body to get there.
Whether patients take drugs as prescribed is also essential to ensuring the right dose gets to where it needs to be often enough to have a desired effect. “Even with all the science that goes into understanding a disease well enough to develop an effective drug, it is often up to the patient to make it all work as designed,” writes pharmaceutical scientist Tom Anchordoquy of the University of Colorado Anschutz.

------------
2. Searching for drug candidates
Researchers have discovered a number of drugs by chance, including penicillin for bacterial infections, vaccines for smallpox and warfarin for blood clots. While serendipity still plays a role in modern drug discovery, most drug developers take a systematic approach.
Scientists typically start by identifying a particular molecular target, usually receptors that trigger a specific response in the body. Then, they look for chemical compounds that react with that target. Technology called high-throughput screening allows researchers to quickly test thousands of potential drug candidates at once. Compounds that match screening criteria advance to further development and refinement. Once optimized for their intended use, compounds go on to safety and efficacy testing in animals and people.
One way to ease the search for optimal drug candidates is to work with compounds that are already optimized to work in living beings. Natural products, derived from organisms like microbes, fungi, plants and animals, share similar structures and functions across species. Though not without their own development challenges, they could aid the search for related compounds that work in people.
“There are thousands of microorganisms in the ocean left to explore as potential sources of drug candidates, not to mention all the ones on land,” writes medical chemist Ashu Tripathi of the University of Michigan. “In the search for new drugs to combat antibiotic resistance, natural products may still be the way to go.”

------------
3. A drug by any other name may be just as effective
Existing drugs can find a second (or third, fourth and fifth) life through repurposing.
Most drugs have many functions beyond what researchers originally designed them to do. While this multifunctionality is often the cause of unwanted side effects, sometimes these results are exactly what’s needed to treat a completely unrelated condition.
Sildenafil, for example, failed to treat severe chest pain from coronary artery disease, but proved to be potent at inducing erections as Viagra. Similarly, thalidomide, a compound that caused birth defects in thousands of infants around the world as a morning sickness drug, found redemption as a cancer treatment.
Because drugs inherently have more than one function in the body, repurposing existing drugs can help fill a gap where pharmaceutical companies and other developers cannot or will not. Gregory Way, a researcher at the University of Colorado Anschutz, uses artificial intelligence to predict the various effects a drug can have and believes that this lack of specificity is something to explore rather than eliminate. Instead of trying to home in on one specific target, he suggests that scientists “embrace the complexity of biology and try to leverage the multifaceted effects drugs can offer.”
------------
Read more: Many medications affect more than one target in the body – some drug designers are embracing the 'side effects' that had been seen as a drawback
------------
4. Poison as medicine
If so many drugs can have toxic effects in the body, be it through side effects or taking the wrong dose or for the wrong condition, what determines whether a drug is a “medicine” or a “poison”?
Biomedical scientists evaluate drugs based on their active ingredient, or a specific compound that has a specific effect in the body. But reducing medicines to just a single molecule ignores another important factor that determines whether a drug is therapeutic – the context in which it is used. Opioids treat intractable pain but can lead to debilitating and lethal addiction when improperly administered. Chemotherapy kills tumors but causes collateral damage to healthy tissues in the process.
Another pharmaceutical paradigm, traditional Chinese medicine, has historically acknowledged the malleability of drugs through the use of poisons as therapeutics.
Yan Liu, a medical historian at University of Buffalo who studies this practice, notes that ancient texts did not distinguish between poisons and nonpoisons – rather, Chinese doctors examined drugs based on a continuum of potency, or ability to harm and heal. They used different processing and administration techniques to adjust the potency of poisons. They also took a personalized approach to treatment, aware that each drug works differently based on a number of different individual factors.
“The paradox of healing with poisons in traditional Chinese medicine reveals a key message: There is no essential, absolute or unchanging core that characterizes a medicine,” Liu writes. “Instead, the effect of any given drug is always relational – it is contingent on how the drug is used, how it interacts with a particular body and its intended effects.”

China: HE Ambassador Wang Xiaolong meets with President of Acupuncture NZ
: HE Ambassador Wang Xiaolong met with Robin Kerr, President of Acupuncture NZ and his entourage in Wellington. The two sides exchanged views on the development of Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture in New Zealand and the cooperation between the two countries in relevant areas.
Having listened to the briefing of President Kerr on the development of the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture in New Zealand, Amb Wang indicated that, as an essential component of the Chinese culture, the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture not only benefit the Chinese communities in New Zealand but also help improve the health of more and more Kiwis. The Chinese side appreciates the efforts of Acupuncture NZ to promote the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture in New Zealand. China aspires to promote people-to-people exchanges and health cooperation with New Zealand, so that the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture will be better developed and benefit even more Kiwis.
According to President Kerr, the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture is not only the treasure of the Chinese traditional culture but also a valuable source of the medical knowledge for the whole humanity. With growth of the Chinese communities and the New Zealand diverse society, the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture will become increasingly popular and practiced in New Zealand. Celebrating the 40th anniversary of the establishment this year, Acupuncture NZ will remain dedicated to promoting the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture in New Zealand, bringing more convenience to both the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners, and at the same time, bringing more benefits to the whole New Zealand society. Acupuncture NZ will work with the Embassy on cooperation and exchanges in relevant areas between China and New Zealand.

Shanghai to Continue Strict Covid-19 Measures Despite Drop in Cases; New action plan calls for more mass testing and quarantine beds, treatment with traditional Chinese medicine
: Cao, Li. 
: HONG KONG—Shanghai health authorities unveiled an aggressive new Covid-19 containment plan despite continued reductions in new cases, indicating China's financial capital is still far from declaring victory over the country's worst outbreak since the start of the pandemic.
According to a nine-point action plan announced just before midnight on Thursday, Shanghai will add more quarantine hospital beds and transfer all Covid-19-positive patients as well as their close contacts to quarantine centers. The plan called for both Covid-19 patients and close contacts to be treated with traditional Chinese medicine, without specifying other treatments.
In certain instances, patients will be allowed to isolate at home, though only on a temporary basis, according to the plan, which also called for the maintenance of strict controls on movement, mass testing and contact tracing.
Shanghai recorded just over 17,500 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday, down from almost 18,500 the day before. It was the eighth drop in daily cases since April 13, when new infections reached a peak of nearly 28,000. Since March 1, the city has recorded roughly 450,000 Covid-19 cases and 36 deaths, including 11 on Thursday.
In an interview with state media posted online Friday, Shanghai's government officials said the government was focused on ensuring that all new infections are contained within quarantined areas and facilities. Once that is achieved, the city will gradually loosen restrictions on movement and activity neighborhood by neighborhood, it said.
"Our goal is to achieve zero Covid at the community level as soon as possible," the government officials said, without providing a timeline.
The announcement of the new action plan comes after falling case counts and loosening of restrictions in some communities had raised hopes among some residents and businesses that Shanghai was turning a corner in its battle against the outbreak.
The lockdown in Shanghai, now in its fourth week, has caused panic among residents over access to food and other necessities. It has also badly disrupted business and slowed transport of goods into the city, one of China's biggest manufacturing and export hubs, to a trickle.
The city's insistence on sending all Covid-19-positive patients to quarantine centers regardless of the severity of their symptoms has drawn criticism from public health experts, many of whom say the fast-spreading but milder Omicron variant of the virus is best fought by allowing patients to isolate at home unless they have severe symptoms.
China's Vice Premier Sun Chunlan visited a district-level disease control center, a hospital that treats Covid-19 patients and a quarantine center in Shanghai on Wednesday and Thursday, according to state media. She reiterated the zero-Covid policy , urging the city to eradicate infections at community level "with greater determination and greater strength."

Stock tonic Chinese traditional medicine maker's shares surge on Covid outbreak
: Riordan, Primrose; Ho-Him, Chan; Lockett, Hudson; Li, Gloria. 
: The stake held by the family behind one of China's largest traditional medicine groups has rocketed in value to $4.5bn after outbreaks of Covid-19 triggered renewed interest in its coronavirus treatment. Shares in Wu Yiling's Shijiazhuang Yiling Pharmaceutical have jumped more than 60 per cent since the end of December despite a US warning against the company's coronavirus treatment. The rally came on top of a 160 per cent gain in early 2020 after Beijing endorsed the treatment. The stock price had hovered at about Rmb8 ($1.26) before the pandemic but hit record levels after the medicine was promoted in Hong Kong, closing out last week at Rmb31.5. The rally has boosted the value of the family's near 55 per cent stake in the company, listed in Shenzhen, to about Rmb28.8bn. Wu is known in China for developing a cardiovascular treatment out of centipede, scorpion, leech and cicada. His company sells Lianhua Qingwen, a coronavirus treatment with ingredients including honeysuckle, liquorice root, apricot seed and forsythia. The treatment from Wu's company was endorsed by Zhong Nanshan, an expert advising the Chinese government on coronavirus, and Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive. Hong Kong is reeling from its biggest outbreak of the pandemic, and a surge in China has forced Shanghai and other cities into lockdown. Beijing has promoted traditional medicine on the global stage in recent years, and state media have trumpeted Shijiazhuang Yiling's success in gaining regulatory approval in African and Middle Eastern countries. But the US Food and Drug Administration, as well as Singaporean and Australian authorities, have warned that there was no evidence that Lianhua Qingwen had any effect on the virus, and cautioned against its use. The FDA said claims that Lianhua Qingwen could prevent or treat Covid were "not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence". The dramatic stock rise began after Lianhua Qingwen was recommended in Beijing's official treatment protocols for coronavirus in March 2020. Wu owns a 31.5 per cent stake in the company, while his son Wu Xiangjun and daughter Wu Rui own collectively 23 per cent, according to the company's latest quarterly report. A version of the drug distributed in mainland China was initially not approved in Hong Kong, where health authorities raided pharmacies selling it in February. Mainland companies have since donated hundreds of thousands of packs to the city.

China: Africa's traditional Chinese medicine boom sparks fears for endangered species
: A massive rise in the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) products in a number of African countries in recent years is fueling demand for endangered species whose body parts are used to make certain ingredients, a recent report has found.
The Chinese government has been ramping up the export and production of TCM products in Africa as part of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Xi Jinping's Belt and Road global connections drive, with chains of TCM suppliers and clinics across the continent, according to a report from the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA).
"The aggressive expansion of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in many African countries is posing a direct threat to the future of some endangered species," the group said in a statement.
EIA campaigner Ceres Kam said traditional medicine is integral to many cultures and plays an important role in global healthcare.
"However, while the majority of TCM treatments are plant-based, some pharmaceutical companies continue to source ingredients from threatened animals, aggravating the pressure on the survival of these species," Kam said.
"Our very real concern is that such a huge expansion of TCM in Africa, as is happening under China's Belt and Road Initiative, will have the knock-on effect of drastically increasing demand for treatments containing wildlife and, in turn, cause more species to become threatened or extinct," she said.
"Any utilization of threatened species in TCM could potentially stimulate further demand, incentivize wildlife crime and ultimately lead to over-exploitation," Kam warned.
Hong Kong writer and activist Riki Ueda, who has volunteered in wildlife conservation in South Africa, agreed.
"The demand for traditional Chinese medicine will increase, and the pressure on these animals will definitely increase," she said, citing a recent rise in ivory poaching following the legalization of trade in existing ivory.
"Is the legal trade contributing to the illegal trade? Both seem to be growing in parallel ... and the [legal trade] is bound to have a negative impact on the species and the illegal wildlife trade alike."
Ueda called for research to support replacing animal parts with plant-based remedies throughout TCM practice.
While the impact of the illegal ivory trade on elephants has been well documented, rhinos are another highly endangered species, with only about 25,000 rhinos left in the wild.
"Since 2008, 5,940 rhinos have been recorded as hunted and killed in Africa," TCM doctor and former Taiwan health ministry official Huang Lin-huang told RFA. "Scientists believe this number is an underestimate."
Now based at Taiwan's embassy in Eswatini, Huang said he has never believed in the efficacy of powdered rhino horn, which was banned in China, before being made legal again in 2018.
"I never believed it had any special curative effects," Huang said. "Folks believe that rhino horn can reduce fever, but salicylic acid can reduce fever."
"Even water poplar bark can do that ... this amplification of the superstitions and traditional uses of rhino horn have contributed to a disaster for rhinos," he said.
Hundreds of rhinos killed
According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in South Africa, poachers killed 394 rhinos in the whole of 2020. But the number rose to 249 in the first half of 2021 alone.
In Botswana, at least 100 rhinos have been killed by poachers in the last three years, since President Mokgweetsi Masisi took office in 2018 and disarmed anti-poaching squads, taking away their right to kill poachers on sight.
According to Ueda, the illegal trade in powdered rhino horn has gotten cleverer at covering its tracks, and many operations now grind the horn into powder and disguise it as beads or other substances before shipping to East Asia.
"These professional poachers are well-trained and can cut off rhino horns within minutes," Huang said.
"In South Africa, you can get up to six years for manslaughter, but up to 15 for killing a rhino, and yet the [poachers] aren't deterred ... because of the huge profits involved," he said.
And there are fears that poaching gangs are infiltrating conservation organizations, too.
Ueda, who has volunteered on a South African nature reserve, said staff on the reserve were very cautious about sharing any rhino-related information with her.
"Some staff were more careful with me at the beginning of my assignment, or were not very willing to talk to me at all," she said.
"Sometimes they would make jokes about 'you Asians coming to poach our rhinos'," she said.
For Ueda, the key lies in educating people back home about the damage their medicines are doing.
"Buyer ignorance and indifference to wild animals is the first target for education," she said. "It's demand from [East] Asia that is killing wild animals in Africa, so we can't just stand by and watch that happen."

China: Chinese traditional medicines increasingly contaminated by chemicals: experts
: Roots, dried fruits, leaves and berries used in traditional Chinese medicine preparations are increasingly contaminated with chemicals, including pesticides and preservatives, experts told RFA during a recent investigation.
Take the wolfberry, or goji berry (lycium barbarum), now popular as a supplement or wellness ingredient around the world. While listings on wholefoods websites outside China now claim to offer "sulfite-free" dried berries, the majority of stock coming out of China is still preserved using sulfites.
"[Sulfur fumigation] is the cheapest form of preservative," Chen Shih-hsiung, an organic agriculture expert on the democratic island of Taiwan, told RFA. "It acts as a preservative, a pesticide and enhances color."
"It's a very common process used by Chinese farmers, and it will be difficult to change that," Chen said.
Taiwan-based food chemistry expert Wang Yuen-chun said the traditional way to preserve herbs and berries is drying them in the sun, but the majority of TCM companies in mainland China now use sulfur fumigation instead, because sun-drying is too labor intensive.
Brightly-colored or light-colored herbs, like sliced white roots and berries, are more likely to have high levels of sulfur, Wang said, because of the color-enhancing effects of fumigation.
Current industry standards agreed between Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China limit sulfur dioxide residues in most TCM products to 150 ppm, with some limited to 400 ppm.
But recent tests carried out on TCM medicines imported from China by the Taipei municipal health bureau found that dried winterflower, gentian and tricosanthes all had sulfur dioxide levels in excess of safety standards.
Wang warned that herbs with a high sulfur content will often give off a pungent odor and taste sour or bitter.
"If it has only been lightly treated with sulfur fumigation, you may not notice the smell or taste," he said.
Chen said a low-tech environment and lack of education among herb-growers in China was a major problem.
"A lot of farmers in China have almost no education, and they are working with outdated technology," he said. "It's not so easy for them to upgrade to modern drying methods."
Sulfur dioxide can combine with the residual moisture in dried herbs to make sulfuric acid, which can damage the skin, respiratory and digestive tract and the immune system if ingested over a long period of time, even resulting in lung, liver and kidney damage, Wang said.
Too much sulfur can also neutralize the active ingredients in Chinese medicine by changing the structure of the original compounds, he said.
China is currently the world's largest producer of TCM materials by far, accounting for 90 percent of the global market.
According to a November 2021 article on the Chinese Medicine Net website, more than 60 percent of raw medical materials including codonopsis, angelica, forsythia, jujube, epimedium and astralagus root have failed to pass quality control tests for pharmacopia products due to lack of medicinal value or pesticide residues.
And yet, demand for TCM products is still strong, with an 80 percent increase in the number of applications to register new TCM products since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The scarcity caused by the lack of newly registered suppliers has sent prices skyrocketing, while manufacturers of untested, substandard or fake products are rushing to fill the gap.
In tests of more than 1,000 batches of unregistered TCM herbal preparations in 2020, China's National Food and Drug Administration found traces of banned pesticides including phorate, carbofuran, DDT, fipronil and BHT.
A profit-driven industry
The problem, according to Chen, is in the profit-driven industrialization of TCM agriculture.
"Traditional Chinese medicine planting uses deep-rooted traditional methods, which states that there's no need for pesticides unless you can see insects, nor for fungicides in the absence of disease, or herbicides in the absence of grass," he said.
"Otherwise, it will lead to disaster in future," said Chen, who calls the industrial use of pesticides "suicide farming."
"It hurts everyone, from the producers to the consumers, and it will leave future generations without farmable land; nobody wins when you use suicide farming methods."
Chen said many TCM herbs have their own insect- and disease-resistant properties.
Dyes are another common substance found in TCM herbs, including Sudan red and other banned red dyes, according to Wang, who says wolfberries and ginseng roots with uneven coloring are more likely to have been sun-dried, while those with a deep, uniform color are more likely to have been dyed.
Among the toxic dyes found in TCM products, Acid Red 73, carmine and Sudan Red are among the most worrying, Wang said.
British studies have shown that six food colorants including carmine can affect children's intelligence and cause behavioral disorders, while combining easily with heavy metals like arsenic, copper, and lead during the manufacturing process.
Carmine colorants are currently banned in Taiwan, the U.S., Canada and Norway, while they can be used in strictly limited quantities in the EU and Japan, among other countries.
Meanwhile, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies Sudan Red colorants as carcinogenic to humans or animals.
Chen isn't optimistic about the future of TCM, despite growing his own medicinal herbs at home.
In the end, enough people will be worried about the toxic side-effects to stop buying it. "Chinese medicine will self-destruct," he said.

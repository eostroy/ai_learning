HE Ambassador Wang Xiaolong met with Robin Kerr, President of Acupuncture NZ and his entourage in Wellington.
The two sides exchanged views on the development of Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture in New Zealand and the cooperation between the two countries in relevant areas.
Having listened to the briefing of President Kerr on the development of the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture in New Zealand, Amb Wang indicated that, as an essential component of the Chinese culture, the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture not only benefit the Chinese communities in New Zealand but also help improve the health of more and more Kiwis.
The Chinese side appreciates the efforts of Acupuncture NZ to promote the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture in New Zealand.
China aspires to promote people-to-people exchanges and health cooperation with New Zealand, so that the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture will be better developed and benefit even more Kiwis.
According to President Kerr, the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture is not only the treasure of the Chinese traditional culture but also a valuable source of the medical knowledge for the whole humanity.
With growth of the Chinese communities and the New Zealand diverse society, the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture will become increasingly popular and practiced in New Zealand.
Celebrating the 40th anniversary of the establishment this year, Acupuncture NZ will remain dedicated to promoting the Chinese traditional medicine and acupuncture in New Zealand, bringing more convenience to both the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners, and at the same time, bringing more benefits to the whole New Zealand society.
Acupuncture NZ will work with the Embassy on cooperation and exchanges in relevant areas between China and New Zealand.

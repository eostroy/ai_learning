Federal cabinet okays key bills while hajj policy delayed again
: Pakistan's federal cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, approved eight key agenda items in a meeting at the Prime Minister's House on Tuesday. However, the approval of the Hajj Policy 2025 was postponed once again due to the absence of Federal Minister for Religious Affairs, Chaudhry Salik. One of the major approvals was for the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill 2024, which was sent to the Cabinet Committee for Legislative Cases. The bill, limited to the Islamabad Capital Territory, aims to establish an institutional framework for the slaughterhouses outside Karachi, preferably near commercial ports," he added. In July, during a briefing to the Senate Standing Committee on Commerce, the Secretary of Commerce noted that there is no ban on exporting donkeys, and Pakistan has already initiated donkey farming. "We have finalised the agreement for donkey hides with China, while discussions on exporting donkey meat are ongoing," the secretary said. Dr Ikram also revealed that new slaughterhouses are being built in Gwadar to facilitate these exports, ensuring that the local market remains unaffected. The slaughterhouse, dedicated to this purpose, will have the capacity to process 216,000 donkeys annually. Addressing concerns about donkey farming, Dr Ikram shared that Pakistan currently has a population of 5.2 million donkeys, according to a recent government census. He acknowledged the need to maintain this population by encouraging local farms to engage in donkey breeding. "We are working to have Chinese companies partner with local farms to provide breeding facilities, creating employment opportunities at the local level," he added. According to Pakistani columnist Tahreem Azeem, who studied in China, donkey meat is a popular delicacy in China's Hebei province, where donkey meat burgers are considered a specialty. "These restaurants proudly display images of donkeys on their exteriors, signalling the availability of donkey meat," she noted. In addition to its culinary uses, donkey hides are also utilised in the production of traditional Chinese medicines. Azeem explained, "Collagen derived from donkey hides is used in medicines, with one such popular product being Ejiao, which is believed to help improve blood circulation, combat insomnia, and treat dry cough.

Pakistan to export meat, hides of 2 lakh donkeys to China every year
: Pakistan plans to export donkey meat and hides to China by the end of this year, as the demand for these products grows in the neighbouring country. Dr Ikram, an official from Pakistan's Ministry of National Food Security and Research, confirmed this development during an interview with Independent Urdu. Dr Ikram stated, "The agreements with China are for the annual supply of 216,000 donkey hides and meat. However, Chinese companies are showing interest in establishing slaughterhouses near Karachi Port." He further explained that due to concerns over food security, slaughterhouses within the city will not be approved to prevent the local market from being impacted. "We are prioritising the establishment of slaughterhouses outside Karachi, preferably near commercial ports," he added. In July, during a briefing to the Senate Standing Committee on Commerce, the Secretary of Commerce noted that there is no ban on exporting donkeys, and Pakistan has already initiated donkey farming. "We have finalised the agreement for donkey hides with China, while discussions on exporting donkey meat are ongoing," the secretary said.

Behind Xi Jinping's Pivot on Broad China Stimulus; A bevy of bad news prompted action from the leader—but not a full U-turn
: Wei, Lingling. 
: With China's economy sinking deeper into a funk last month, Xi Jinping finally decided something had to be done.
After resisting calls to take forceful steps to prop up the economy for two years, Xi relented in late September and ordered a barrage of interest-rate cuts and other measures to put a floor under growth.
But Xi didn't give his economic mandarins a blank check. According to officials and government advisers close to decision-making, he wanted to bail out indebted Chinese municipalities on the brink of collapse and revive the stock market without veering too far from his focus on letting the state drive China's transformation into an industrial and technological powerhouse.
For Xi, the officials and advisers say, the near-term goal isn't to massively stimulate demand but to fend off a brewing financial crisis—or "derisking," in official lingo—thereby helping to stabilize the overall economy and achieve the 5%-or-so growth target for this year.
The resulting mixed message on what exact stimulus was coming has sent investors on a roller-coaster ride. Markets were initially energized by interest-rate cuts and other easing measures by the central bank only to be deflated by lackluster news conferences from other economic agencies short on details.
Investors, who had been hoping for a massive stimulus package similar to what Beijing rolled out during the global financial crisis, were unsure what to make of what Beijing depicted as a "package of incremental policies."
That means little change to Xi's overarching agenda of directing state resources toward fortifying China's industries against perceived foreign threats. Calls from economists and investors inside and outside China for rebalancing the economy to household consumption from manufacturing haven't gained much traction.
The shift, tactical rather than strategic, is centered on the central bank and the state coffers providing liquidity support for local governments and big banks, the backbone of funding for the Chinese economy.
Another focus of the policies is to rescue China's stock market, which has been on a losing streak for nearly four years. The People's Bank of China is taking the unprecedented step of encouraging brokerage firms, insurers, and listed companies to tap central-bank or commercial-bank funding to buy stocks.
Support for household consumption has mainly come from a reduction in mortgage rates, part of a new push to arrest the multiyear downturn in the property market. Analysts estimate that the cut can save homeowners about 150 billion yuan, roughly $21 billion, in interest payments, a meager relief given the trillions of dollars in annual household consumption in China.
Xi's centralization of decision-making, which has time and again led to abrupt policy twists and turns, is adding to the opaqueness and unpredictability of Beijing's economic policy, potentially increasing rather than decreasing risks associated with investing in China.
Since Beijing said late last month that it would do more to prop up the economy, many investors have found themselves on edge, fearing that they might either miss out on a rally or get sucked into a short-term pop. Some have been anxiously waiting for government briefings for any signs of additional stimulus or lack thereof.
"Investing in China used to never be like this," says Eric Wong, founder of Stillpoint Investments, a New York-based asset manager specializing in Chinese equities. "In the past, you could just invest based on company fundamentals. Now we're getting into such a bind guessing what they will say."
A festering liquidity crisis
In late 2022, Xi suddenly scrapped strict Covid restrictions that had left the country isolated for more than two years and badly battered the economy, after protests across China's big cities. There was no warning to doctors and nurses of the abrupt policy reversal, leaving hospitals unprepared for a flood of patients.
The shift on economic policy came just as abruptly.
For the past couple of years, after China dropped its self-imposed Covid isolation, economists and investors have called on Beijing to take forceful action to prop up growth—a mission more urgent after previous government intervention sapped energy out of a vast private sector and turned a property boom into a bust.
Officials in charge of day-to-day economic affairs held increasingly urgent meetings to discuss ways to address the real-estate meltdown and the immense strain on local governments running out of money.
Yet despite all that prodding, Xi had appeared determined to stay his hand.
As recently as late June, his handpicked premier, Li Qiang, who had likened China's post-Covid economy to a patient in recovery, stressed the need to avoid using "strong medicine" to support growth.
"According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine," the premier said, "strong medicine cannot be given at this time. It should be adjusted accurately and slowly to gradually restore [the patient's] foundations." Chinese stocks tanked following these remarks.
Then, by mid-September, it became clear that the economy had taken a turn for the worse. Signs of malaise were spreading.
Real-estate woes were deepening, further pushing down consumption already weakened by a gloomy economic outlook.
The jobless rate among people ages 16 to 24 kept climbing, posing a challenge to the leadership's much-prized social and political stability. And the benchmark of mainland-traded stocks, the CSI 300 Index, was headed for an unprecedented fourth straight year of losses.
What's more, reports were flowing into the power center in Beijing of a festering liquidity crisis across China, according to the officials and government advisers close to Beijing's decision-making. In particular, financially strained local governments have been struggling to pay civil servants as well as state-owned and private contractors.
"There is a severe shortage of cash among local governments," said one of the people familiar with the situation. "Something has to be done to avoid a full-blown crisis."
But any significant action had to come from Xi, who until recently had shown few signs of worry over the economy.
By late September, the din of bad news was becoming too much even for Xi, who decided to act.
The fine print
On Sept. 24, the central bank led the charge to announce rate cuts and other steps to shore up growth and the stock market.
The breadth of the easing measures taken by the central bank surprised even some financial officials in Beijing.
Notably, Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People's Bank of China, announced plans to set up a facility aimed at guiding commercial banks to lend to listed companies for the purpose of share buybacks.
Some analysts questioned the rationale behind the measure, as companies usually buy back stocks with their own money as opposed to borrowed funds. Nonetheless, the measure reflects Xi's desire to revive stock trading, according to the officials and advisers close to Beijing's decision-making.
The central-bank briefing on Sept. 24 immediately led to a surge of Chinese stocks traded both on the mainland and in Hong Kong. Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs Group and BlackRock raised their recommendation on Chinese equities, though they cautioned that they still see long-term challenges for China's economy.
China's state media also jumped into the fray by touting record account openings at Chinese brokerages.
For investors and analysts, the ensuing trading frenzy has become reminiscent of what became known as the "Uncle Xi bull market" of 2015, when a government push to encourage stock investing resulted in an epic stock rally in the first half of that year. A big question now is whether the gains will take hold—or turn into a crash just as the 2015 market boom did.
To that end, investors have been hanging on every word from Beijing.
An Oct. 8 briefing by Beijing's top economic-planning agency disappointed the market with some vague pro-growth pledges but few specifics. It also laid bare the leadership's resolve to continue aiding high-end manufacturing such as electric cars even though such industry-centric policy has led to wasteful overproduction at home and heightened trade tensions with the West.
The Finance Ministry's briefing on Saturday reignited hopes that some sizable fiscal support is in the offing.
"The unprecedented series of press conferences by Xi's policy team demonstrates that Xi now recognizes that China's economy is on the wrong track," said Andy Rothman, China strategist at Matthews Asia, a U.S.-based fund manager, "and that a pragmatic course correction is urgently needed."
Some investors have decided not to pounce yet.
Idanna Appio, a portfolio manager at First Eagle Investments, said the New York asset-management firm, which specializes in long-term holdings, hasn't changed its allocation to Chinese assets despite the flurry of policy moves from Beijing.
"Without measures to address the oversupply of real estate, the related debt risks and local government's heavy reliance on the property market," Appio said, "these recent easing efforts may not be sufficient to tackle China's deeper economic challenges."
For now, many of the new policy measures are less about providing direct stimulus to the economy and more about stabilizing local finances and, by extension, the overall financial system and the economy.
Following its briefing two weeks ago, the central bank has set up a swap facility to allow eligible brokerages, insurers and fund managers to access highly liquid government bonds by pledging certain assets—such as stocks—as collateral.
According to people familiar with the decision-making, this isn't a stimulus measure, but rather a derisking step.
Here, Beijing took a page from what the U.S. did during the 2008 global financial crisis, when authorities allowed investment banks and others to obtain liquidity by pledging their assets as collateral.
In China, banks can always borrow from the interbank market to stay liquid, but that market is off limits to brokerages and insurance firms. As a result, this new swap facility is intended to provide those nonbank financial firms with liquidity in the event of a crisis.
During his press conference on Saturday, Finance Minister Lan Fo'an indicated that a new round of fiscal support from the central government will be focused on backfilling local-government budget shortfalls, helping localities swap maturing debt for new borrowing, and beefing up the capital base of major state banks.
Absent from the measures are any significant moves to boost consumption. People close to the ministry say that such measures are in the works but that nothing substantial is imminent.
Analysts project that China's top legislature, the National People's Congress Standing Committee, will approve the issuance of about $284 billion of so-called special sovereign bonds at the next meeting scheduled for later this month. Most of the bonds are expected to be used for the purpose of local-debt swaps and bank-capital injection.
The officials and advisers close to Beijing's decision-making say that the central government is putting budget constraints on some heavily indebted localities in exchange for them getting funding support from the center. While the move shows an attempt at much-needed financial discipline from Beijing, it could also lead to those localities reducing spending, potentially worsening the nation's deflationary problems .
But a pivot is a pivot. For many analysts and investors, Beijing's plan to rescue local governments and stabilize the financial sector is one positive step toward steadying the economy.
However, China still has a way to go before the economy stages a meaningful recovery. First and foremost, many economists have said, the power center needs to do a big U-turn on the focus of state support—from factories to households.
"China's leadership isn't prepared to unleash the 'bazooka' necessary to power a strong recovery in demand and to end deflation," said Michael Hirson, head of China Research at New York-based consulting firm 22V Research, "but is taking important steps to stabilize growth and lower tail risks."

Macao/China: Former top judge elected as Macao's first leader born in mainland China
: Macao's former top judge, Sam Hou Fai, was chosen as the Chinese casino hub' s next leader in a largely ceremonial election on Sunday, setting him up to become the city's first chief executive born in mainland China.
Almost the entire election committee stacked with Beijing loyalists - 394 of 398 - voted for Sam, the sole candidate, in a departure from the long-standing custom of having chief executives who were born in the former Portuguese colony, typically from influential business families. The remaining four were blank votes.
The shift in the city's leadership to someone from the legal profession is likely to create expectations of a declining influence from business circles, which critics have often accused of colluding with officials, analysts say. They anticipate Beijing's policy agenda for the city will take priority.
Sam, 62, is widely seen to have Beijing's blessings. During the nomination period, he had already secured endorsements from 386 election committee members who voted in batches in a conference hall on Sunday.
Influential figures among the 400-strong committee were Shun Tak Holdings' group executive chairperson Pansy Ho, daughter of late casino tycoon Stanley Ho, lawmaker Angela Leong, one of Ho's widows, and former chief executives Edmund Ho and Fernando Chui.
After being announced as the chief executive-elect, Sam walked onto the stage to applause from the committee members.
"It is the highest honor of my life," Sam said.
He pledged to uphold national sovereignty, accelerate economic diversification of the city and better integrate it into the national development plans.
Sam is expected to assume office in December, when the city marks the 25th anniversary of its handover to China's rule.
After the election, China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Macao's incumbent city leader Ho Iat Seng and Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee congratulated Sam in separate statements.
Most of the territory's 687,000 residents lack voting rights, leading to mixed sentiments about the election. Some hope Sam will heed public opinion and avoid prioritizing business interests, while others feel disconnected from an election process they can't participate in.
Still, political observers said many residents are comfortable with Sam's nonlocal origin in a city that has been home to migrants for decades.
The real challenges now await in the governance hurdles that lie ahead.
Macao is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Beijing has called for the city to diversify its gambling-reliant economy.
Sam has promised to accelerate the current government's plan to boost tourism and other sectors such as traditional Chinese medicine, finance, exhibitions and commerce. However, the city will still need to rely on the gambling industry for government revenues to support the city's welfare and accomplish other goals laid out by Beijing, analysts say.
China wants Macao to develop into a world-class tourism and leisure center and play a bigger role as a bridge for trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
Small local businesses have been hurt by residents who spend money in the neighboring mainland city of Zhuhai, which offers a wider selection of items with good value for money. Chinese tourists are also now spending less than before.
It remains to be seen whether Sam, with a lack of government leadership experience, can form a capable Cabinet to tackle these pressing issues.
Sam told reporters on Sunday that Macao's development cannot be separated from the support that comes from China, saying the city would have to "actively" participate in the development of the Greater Bay Area - Beijing's plan to integrate the casino hub and Hong Kong with other mainland Chinese cities in neighboring Guangdong province.
Sam said that just because the city has a capitalistic economy doesn't mean the government needs to play a passive role.
"In the future, we have to enhance the government's ways of making decisions and such capabilities," he said.
Seafood restaurant operator Ip Weng U, 49, said Macao faces social and economic problems that cannot be resolved quickly. He hopes Sam will do a better job than his predecessors.
"He was a judge, so people have expectations toward him," he said.
Sam was born in neighboring Guangdong province in 1962. He graduated from the prestigious law school of Peking University in Beijing. He also studied the Portuguese language, culture and law at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, and once practiced law in mainland China.
When Macao returned to Chinese rule in 1999, Sam was appointed the city's top judge, a role in which he served for nearly 25 years before resigning in August to participate in the election.
He handled some politically sensitive cases, including rejecting an appeal of a police ban on a vigil commemorating China's bloody 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. His court also upheld a decision to bar pro-democracy figures from running in the 2021 legislative elections. - VOA

Float away: TRAVEL MALDIVES
: Charis Perkins tests her commitment to journalism.
“You did what?!” The blood has drained from my husband’s face. It’s been a few hours since I left him lounging poolside at our beach villa to cycle barefoot and carefree along the jungle paths to an appointment at Soneva Fushi’s wellness centre, Soneva Soul. And, to be frank, the afternoon hasn’t gone quite as expected.
The Maldives resort, mothership to a trio of “barefoot escapes” that go deep in their practice of eco luxury, takes the concept of wellness so seriously it has a fulltime Ayurvedic doctor, naturopathic doctor, traditional Chinese medicine practitioner and regular medical doctor, who consult from rooms above the spa.
My appointment this afternoon was with the naturopathic doctor, New Yorker Michelle Valdes, followed by a “60-minute session” she’d recommended specially for me. For some reason – probably to do with the array of tranquil spa treatment rooms reached via stepping stones along a circular waterway downstairs – I was imagining being anointed with a bunch of herbs, preferably in a steambath or something.
Instead, Valdes gets me to lie down on a common medical examination bed, straps a tourniquet around my upper arm, fi nds a good vein and plunges in a needle. I work hard at not panicking as she drains just under a cupful of my blood, red black and rather precious to me, into a bag. She hangs this on an IV stand, adds a few syringes worth of ozone (a gas composed of three oxygen atoms), mixes it in by squinching the bag, and then reverses the transfusion process. The blood streams back into my vein, now slightly cold and deep pink in colour, like watermelon. (I have before and after photos to prove this.) Valdes, who has a doctorate from the University of Bridgeport School of Naturopathic Medicine in Connecticut, became interested in alternative treatments after she was diagnosed with lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease, at the age of 23. Suffi ce to say, she’s glowing with wellness. As for the ozone therapy (listed on Soneva Soul’s integrative medicine menu as Major Autohemotherapy, $US375 for 45 minutes), she tells me a previous guest who’d been on medication for rheumatoid arthritis for eight years had been able to sleep without her pain meds for the fi rst time after just one treatment.
“How are you feeling?” she asks as she escorts me back downstairs. Perhaps a little fl oaty, I reply. Though maybe that’s just lightheadedness from relief at no longer having a needle in my arm.
The menu says the treatment will leave me “feeling energised, with increased mental clarity”. It’s unclear whether I’m more clear-headed, but by the time my husband and I are escorted to a table at the over-the-water Out of the Blue restaurant for dinner, I am feeling great.
But then, who wouldn’t be? This is our fi rst of two nights at the legendary Soneva Part of the tiny Makunudhoo Atoll, it’s so remote, the next landmass to the west across the Indian Ocean is Somalia. When the last three guest lodgings are completed, including the Maldives’ fi rst fl oating villa, this ultra exclusive getaway will have just 14 villas – each with a fully equipped gym and spa treatment room – and 14 chefs specialising in 14 cuisines to privately cater to occupants’ dining whims.
But back to the dinner at Over the Water, which serves Japanese, Chinese and South- East Asian cuisines, using mostly fruit and vegetables grown on the island.
I’ve just explained to my husband that I will be forgoing a pre-dinner cocktail on Dr Valdes’ advice, to give the ozone therapy the best chance to work. Which is why he’s gone pale with shock. Ozone therapy!? Am I mad? Did I not know it was quackery, and possibly dangerous?
I shrug. Would Soneva Soul be offering such a treatment if there was any chance it would harm their guests? Besides which, I did it in the interests of journalism. All the same, my injected arm is beginning to throb. Could that be a blood clot forming?
Perhaps I will wake up dead before even getting the chance to snorkel in the crystalline water in front of our villa. No, hang on. That’s not right. You defi nitely cannot wake up and be dead, I reason, perhaps a sign of new clear-headedness.
Later I Google ozone therapy and learn that the US Food and Drug Administration prohibits its use “in any medical condition for which there is no proof of safety and effectiveness” and that an ozone clinic in Sydney’s west has been banned from operating while the state health authority investigates “intravenous and skinpuncture procedures”. None of this helps my mental clarity, so I drop the subject.
The next day, at the outdoor gathering place Mihiree Mithaa, where an extraordinarily bountiful buffet breakfast is laid on under the trees, I knock back the bitterest tea I have ever tasted, Andrographis Paniculate, at the urging of the “chief hostess”.
It will help build my immunity, she assures me. There is no way I would voluntarily drink a second cup, but I drain the fi rst one in the interests of journalism.
And perhaps it does boost my immunity.
When my husband succumbs to a throat infection a few days later, I don’t. It may be a coincidence, it may not.
Perhaps I’m protected by that afternoon’s treatment back at Soneva Soul, this time with Ayurvedic practitioner Vidya Dinesh. The ancient medical practice is mainstream in India, with Ayurvedic hospitals operating alongside the conventional healthcare system. But I’m not here for a traditional treatment evolved over millennia. I’m booked in for a session of hyperbaric oxygen therapy ($US200 for 60 minutes or $US230 for 90 minutes).
I climb into what looks like a collapsed blue swag with two portholes at head height. Dr Dinesh hands me a walkie-talkie to communicate, slips an oxygen mask over my nose and zips me in, securing the whole shebang with buckles. Again, I concentrate on not panicking. But once the chamber is pumped up to a pressure my ears can stand (75 per cent of the maximum 4 PSI), I fall into a cool-washed reverie and imagine all that compressed 100 per cent oxygen fl ooding my tissues to promote “healing, regeneration and detoxifi cation” .
The integrative medicine menu at Soneva Soul is 13 pages long, offering everything from shirodhara (warm medicated oil, milk, butter milk or a decoction poured continuously on the forehead to restore emotional balance by stimulating the pineal gland) to vitamin injections, stem cell treatments and microneedling with hyaluronic acid, although you won’t fi nd common aesthetic offerings like botox and fi llers. Soneva is all about natural healing therapies .
On the spa menu, there are massages, facials, body wraps, 24-carat gold agedefying facials… And that’s before you get on to the yoga, singing bowls, personal training, meditation, health boost shots presented at every meal, detox and sleep programs, visiting specialists and a fi ve-day annual wellness festival ending on Sunday.
At Soneva Jani, opened in 2016 and the third stop on our six-night Soneva deep dive, the offering spans two wellness centres, one with open-air spa treatment rooms that follow the island’s protected eastern shoreline along a wooden walkway raised above the treeline, and another at The Gathering, a huge and airy overwater complex built entirely of wood that is the resort’s main centre.
By now, after days of massages, yoga sessions, snorkelling, dolphin spotting, and divine meals, I am genuinely fl oating.
It is at Jani that my wellness-sceptic husband agrees to join me for a 60-minute signature couple’s massage, in one of the open-air treatment rooms.

What's pushing the steady rise of 'mushroom wellness'?
: New Delhi, Oct. 9 -- As the quest for holistic health solutions continues to gain momentum, one natural remedy is currently emerging as a front runner: mushrooms. Renowned for their rich nutritional profile, mushrooms are celebrated for their ability to regulate blood sugar levels, enhance brain function, and improve heart and bone health among their other benefits. In recent years, exotic varieties of the fungus such as Reishi, Chaga, Lion's Mane, and Cordyceps have captured the attention of health enthusiasts and experts alike. Brewed into teas and coffees, added to smoothies and soups in the form of powders, and turned into supplements, these remarkable fungi can be thoughtfully integrated into your diet to enhance overall health and well-being.
Tarun Ahuja, founder of And Fungi, a provider of premium home-grown (medicinal and gourmet) mushrooms, emphasises the broad appeal of these edible fungi, noting that nutritionally, they are a powerhouse of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support immune function, energy levels, and overall health. "Mushrooms like Reishi, Chaga, and Lion's Mane are revered for their adaptogenic properties, which help the body adapt to stress and restore balance," he adds. Shiitake, Turkey Tail, Maitake, Oyster and Tremella are other mushroom varieties that are recognised for their medicinal potency.
While the use of mushroom as medicine is ancient, ongoing research by scientific community is increasingly backing it. For instance, a 2023 study conducted by researchers from the University of Queensland in Australia along with scientists in South Korea proved the cognitive benefits of Lion's Mane, linking it to improved brain health. A 2016 study on Cordyceps, Effect of Cordyceps sinensis on Exercise Performance in Healthy Older Subjects, found that it had the ability to enhance athletic performance in individuals by increasing their oxygen uptake and endurance.
In addition to their health benefits, mushrooms are also lauded for their sustainability. "Mushrooms are an environmentally-friendly choice because they require minimal resources to grow," Ahuja says before adding, "Their versatility allows them to be easily integrated into our daily diets, whether as fresh ingredients, in dried forms, or extracts, making them suitable for everything from dietary supplements to gourmet dishes."
It's the steadily rising momentum of mushroom wellness combined with curiosity among health enthusiasts everywhere that pushed Richa Jaggi and Shivam Singhee, founders of Delhi-based medical cannabis wellness startup, Awshad, to venture into this emerging category as well. Their catalogue currently features Calmashroom, a cannabis-infused supplement with Cordyceps, and Myndshroom, a capsule designed to support brain health through a blend of three medicinal mushrooms: Lion's Mane, Cordyceps and L-Thianine.
"An increasing demand for natural, plant-based health products and treatments, and a growing shift from chemical-based synthetic medicines is pushing (medicinal) mushrooms' popularity as alternative solutions to manage stress and strengthen the body's immunity," says Jaggi. Citing an example of a recent trend, she says, "Cordyceps sinensis, a rare and expensive mushroom originally used in traditional Chinese medicine for its athletic performance-enhancing effect, is gaining a lot of popularity and being used by today's athletes and health enthusiasts."
According to Himalayan Siddhaa Akshar, founder of Akshar Yoga Kendraa, both Ayurveda and modern medicine recognise the health benefits of mushrooms, although they approach them from different perspectives. "Ayurveda acknowledges the medicinal value of mushrooms while consumed in moderate doses, but due to their potential to lower mental clarity when overconsumed, it classifies them as tamasic. Modern science, on the other hand, highlights their immune-boosting, antioxidant and adaptogenic properties ," he states.
Ayurveda promotes the use of medicinal mushrooms like Reishi and Cordyceps, Akshar further points out. Besides their adaptogenic properties, these mushrooms enhance vitality, support immune function, and promote longevity when consumed mindfully." Mushrooms, he adds, are also a natural source of vitamin D, making them an excellent supplement for bone health, especially for those with limited sun exposure.
As research expands and consumer preferences evolve, mushrooms are poised to play an increasingly vital role in the wellness landscape.
Akshar acknowledges that the power of these fungi is just beginning to be realised, but cautions, "One needs to be mindful of their usage and dosage to derive maximum benefits and avoid any potential negative effects." "As more people learn about mushrooms and their advantages, its consumption will increase especially in the wellness space, with them being moulded into a variety of innovative products such as gummies and tinctures," Jaggi predicts.

China Broadens Access for Foreign Investment
: China deepened its push to further open up the economy, eliminating restrictions on the manufacturing sector and expanding opportunities for foreign investment in the health sector in an effort to revive growth.
The Chinese government will reduce its list of industries off-limits to foreign investors to 29 from 31 and fulfill its pledge of zero restrictions on the manufacturing sector, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Commerce Ministry said in a joint statement on Sunday.
The new list, set to take effect Nov. 1, removes the requirement for Chinese majority control in publication printing businesses and lifts the ban on investment in Chinese herbal-medicine production.
Since 2019, Beijing has steadily reduced its so-called negative list of more than 100 sectors to attract foreign capital.
China's Commerce Ministry on Sunday also announced plans to further open the nation's healthcare sector.
Foreign investors can now establish wholly foreign-owned hospitals in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hainan island, according to the ministry. Acquiring public hospitals and facilities involved in traditional Chinese medicine will remain off-limits.
Additionally, companies with foreign investment are allowed to engage in the development and application of human stem cell, gene diagnosis and treatment technologies in pilot free-trade zones in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Hainan. All medical products that have been registered and approved by authorities can be marketed for sale nationwide.

Films About Women Are Having a Moment in China; A wave of cultural content reflects a hunger for women plotlines; some scenes on gender tensions get scrubbed
: Qi, Liyan; Fan, Wenxin. 
: Since its release in 2022, the documentary "Hidden Letters," about an ancient Chinese writing system only used by women, has been nominated for an Emmy and shortlisted for an Academy Award.
Recently, it achieved something equally significant: getting onto big screens in China.
The story follows two-present-day practitioners of Nushu, a written language created during China's imperial era, when women weren't allowed in schools, and passed down through generations to provide women with a secret way to connect.
The version of the film shown in China cut scenes referring to women's modern-day struggles with gender expectations at a time when the government strives to reinforce traditional family values . Yet, the movie's release in China also illustrates the growing appetite in the country for cultural content about women's issues as women increasingly chafe under official and societal mores.
Directed by Violet Du Feng and Zhao Qing, the documentary features Hu Xin, a divorced Nushu expert working in a museum, and Wu Simu, a music teacher and self-taught Nushu artist who was hoping to get married.
Feng, who is from Shanghai but based in New York City, said the intention was to use Nushu as a lens to contrast men's view on women's role in society with women's evolving perceptions of themselves.
In the modified version, a scene has been cut where Hu compares patriarchal practices described in Nushu with abuse in her own marriage and discusses how her husband pressured her to have an abortion after finding out she was pregnant with a girl. Instead, in a new voice-over not in the original version, Hu says she has formed her own opinions of marriage that diverge from her husband's views on traditional gender roles, and cites his desire for a son as the reason for their divorce.
The modified version also has added content promoting "positive energy"—messages endorsed by Beijing.
Several rounds of editing based on feedback from different government agencies is the norm for directors who want to release their movies in China, so the two-year delay the directors for "Hidden Letters" faced isn't surprising, said Karen Ma, author of "China's Millennial Digital Generation," which profiles seven young Chinese directors.
"They are lucky to get it off the ground," Ma said. "I know many directors whose work didn't."
Any movie shown in Chinese theaters needs a release permit known as the "dragon logo," named for the image of a golden dragon shown at the beginning of every movie. Getting one can take months or years. And even a release permit doesn't guarantee a movie will ultimately be shown.
The China Film Administration, which grants movie-release permits, didn't reply to a request for comment.
In culture and entertainment, themes on gender tension have put Chinese authorities in a bind at a time when Chinese women are resisting official pressure to have more children after China ended its one-child policy. Officials fearing to stray away from the Communist Party line treat such topics with extreme caution.
But their caution is running up against a surge in "everyday feminism," exemplified by social-media discussions, podcasts, blogs and comedy shows scrutinizing the place of women in society without straying into overt feminist activism, making it more difficult for authorities to suppress.
On tech behemoth Tencent and streaming giant iQiyi, a steady lineup of female comedians are cracking jokes on topics ranging from the preference for sons in traditional Chinese culture to "leftover women," a derogatory term for single women heading into their 30s.
In one performance streamed to millions of Tencent viewers, a rookie comedian who goes by the stage name Caicai keeps the audience laughing throughout an eight-minute set about menstrual stigma, including the description of an embarrassed delivery man attempting to hide an order of sanitary pads in a dark grocery bag. Another performance includes a punchline about how men who have watched too many ads about feminine-care products think menstrual blood is blue .
After Caicai's show went viral, many women flocked to her social-media account and shared their own encounters with the stereotype. And she shared with them why she chose the topic.
"Shame is always a feature in a woman's life growing up," said Caicai. "This show, I hope, would break the taboo."
One after another, films and shows centered on women's issues have been among the top performers at the box office, partly because more women go to see movies than men.
The share of women in Chinese audiences grew to 61% from 54%, between the summer seasons of 2021 and 2023, according to data from the Lighthouse Research Institute, an arm under Alibaba Group Holding.
Early this year, "YOLO" (short for You Only Live Once), a movie about a woman going through physical and mental transformations to become a boxer, directed by Jia Ling who also stars, brought in nearly $500 million and was one of the top-grossing movies of the year. Another of Jia's movies, "Hi, Mom," released in 2021, topped $700 million.
Part of the commercial success by Jia, a well-known comedian, is that her story lines are closer to the mainstream, said Ma.
A movie premiering in mid-September, "Like a Rolling Stone," based on the story of Su Min, a retiree who video-blogged about her solo road trip around China to escape a toxic marriage, is expected to be another box-office triumph.
With about three million followers across social-media platforms, Su has become an icon for many women.
The movie used to carry a different title, "Dear Mama," which was dropped after objections from many of Su's followers, who argued that it had deviated too far from how Su depicts herself—as someone who has left the demands of family life.
"I hope it will show those who feel trapped by life that there are other possibilities and choices," said Su in her blog earlier this month, commenting on the movie.
Two years ago, Su announced on her blog that she would seek a divorce, a decision not mentioned in the film, based on a prescreening. In July, her husband agreed to divorce.
"Hidden Letters," which opened in Chinese theaters on Aug. 31, was met with mixed reviews among Chinese audiences, with many women going on social media to share their personal experience, such as workplace discrimination. Some said the female protagonists' thoughts, such as their pursuit of marriage and love, were outdated.
In the film's original version, one scene shows a "princess camp" where Nushu script is featured on the walls and where little girls are taught how to stand and walk properly and to meet expectations from men. Feng, the co-director, says the scene is an example of how Nushu script has been co-opted in the name of traditional values. In the version shown in China, the princess-camp scene has been cut in its entirety.
Some scenes were partially kept. The original version showed how the then-fiancé of Wu, the music teacher, when visiting his family, pushes her to drink a bowl of traditional Chinese medicine to make her fit to bear children. It is a tension-filled scene, later followed by the end of the relationship.
The new version kept the scene but cut why her fiancé wanted her to drink the bitter medicine.
Asked whether she thinks the message of the film has been weakened, Feng responded, "It's not as powerful as the original version. Some audiences may not get the idea. Still, it means a lot to me for the documentary to be shown in China."
The theme around the core value of Nushu, sisterhood, has been left largely intact, Feng said.

Asia: EXPLAINED: The (worrying) popularity of caterpillar fungus
: By now the army of scavengers has retreated from the high hillsides of the eastern Tibetan plateau, their bounty in hand. Harvest season for yartsa gunbu (), or caterpillar fungus, typically runs from May to July, when winter snows have receded and thousands of rural, ethnic Tibetans can prospect for what's also known as soft gold.
It's hard to overstate the importance these few weeks hold for the people who climb the steep slopes. Collecting caterpillar fungus - which is used to treat a variety of ailments - can account for as much as 90% of a rural family's annual income.
But high demand has spurred overharvesting, making it harder to find the fungus in its natural environment. Climate change poses another challenge. Warmer temperatures on the high plateau are reducing the length of winter, a critical time for yartsa gunbu.
Now a new threat is emerging, sources inside China say: artificial varieties designed to fill the gaps between supply and demand, in the form of either cultivated fungi or fake products altogether. Although Chinese authorities have tried to regulate the sale of cultivated fungus, interviews with Tibetans and online videos that attract tens of thousands of viewers say imposters have infiltrated the market.
It will definitely jeopardize the lives of thousands of Tibetan herders and farmers whose income depend on the wild yartsa, said Lobsang Yeshi, who has practiced traditional Tibetan medicine at Men-Tsee-Khang in Dharamshala, India, for the past 20 years.
What is caterpillar fungus and where does it come from?
Yartsa gunbu translates to summer grass, winter bug. The Ophiocordyceps sinensis - its scientific name - releases spores that sink underground and infect the larvae of ghost moths, so called for the white color of males. The yartsa gunbu takes over, commandeering the caterpillar's nervous system, consuming its organs and finally, in spring, emerging from its head as a brown stoma at altitudes of greater than 13,000 feet (4,000 meters). Its methods have drawn comparisons to the fungus that stars in the HBO hit zombie series, The Last of Us. Harvested intact, it's about the length of a little finger and shaped like a caterpillar with a stem attached.
Yartsa gunbu is found primarily in the Himalaya mountains and the Tibetan plateau. The Yushu Tibetan Autonomous prefecture in Qinghai province, east of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, is a particularly good place to look. Thousands of its residents set up makeshift camps from which they hike into the thin air.
The annual harvest is reportedly around 300 million fungi that can cost $7 a pop or more, leaving a multi-billion dollar market.
What is caterpillar fungus used for?
Yartsa gunbu has been used in Tibetan and Chinese traditional medicine to treat heart, liver and lung ailments. More recently, it acquired a reputation for improving sexual stamina in men and women. (Himalayan Viagra is another moniker.) Studies have shown possible benefits, though scientists say more clinical research is needed.
Users consume yartsa gunbu by brewing it with hot water similar to how tea or herbal infusions are prepared, or chewing it as it comes. Some put it in soups and other recipes. Lesser specimens are ground into powders.
Why are people growing a fungus ?
Pluckers like to pick the fungus before it releases spores, limiting its ability to reproduce and leading to its population decline. China has encouraged the development of cultivated yartsa gunbu, and one company has reportedly solved the puzzle, synthetically growing the O. sinensis fungus found in the wild.
But some individuals are trying to cultivate fungus varieties on their own. That, fungus traders say, has undercut prices and, because the buyer's remain suspicious of its medicinal properties, consumer confidence, several sources told RFA.
In Guangzhou, a major market, there is a hesitancy of customers in buying because of too much artificial fungus in the market, one trader said. A Tibetan living in Qinghai province said prices have dropped nearly 20% this year.
In New York, a retailer said he can still sell a single piece of wild fungus for $14, but there are a lot of fake and cultivated yartsa undercutting the business, he said. "Nowadays, people are selling thousands of artificial yartsa online per day, as well as in shops, jeopardizing the original yartsa business," he said.
Studies have shown that cultivated fungus can replicate the chemical compounds of natural varieties, though there are differences.
What is China doing to protect the market?
Chinese authorities seem to be aware of the financial risks to some of their poorest populations.
In April, the Chinese government in Qinghai, tried to control the artificial plantation of yartsa gunbu. But a trader in Nagchu, Tibet Autonomous Region, an area that historically has been among the best for finding wild yartsa gunbu, said enforcement has been lax.
"Chinese authorities have come out with a lot of rules saying that the artificial fungus is banned, the trader said. But the on-ground reality is that the Chinese authorities are not strictly monitoring or stopping the sale of artificial fungus. And this is making it tough for us to sell the real fungus."

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The Beijing Summit and Ninth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) was held in Beijing from September 4 to 6, 2024. The Heads of State, Government and delegation of China and 53 African countries and Chairperson of the African Union Commission (hereinafter referred to as the two sides) and their ministers of foreign affairs and of economic cooperation attended the summit and ministerial conference respectively.
1.2 The two sides speak highly of FOCAC's achievements over the past 24 years. It has kept pace with the prevailing trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation, overcome challenges posed by the changing and turbulent international environment, sluggish global economic recovery and the COVID pandemic, and promoted the comprehensive and in-depth development of friendship and cooperation between China and Africa. It has become an efficient platform for South-South cooperation and a shining example of catalyzing international cooperation with Africa.
1.3 The two sides are satisfied with the comprehensive and effective implementation of the Nine Programs, Dakar Action Plan (2022-2024), China-Africa Cooperation Vision 2035, and Declaration on China-Africa Cooperation on Combating Climate Change put forward at the eighth FOCAC Ministerial Conference and their follow-up actions. The two sides welcome the success of the China-Africa Leaders' Dialogue held in South Africa and the launch of the Initiative on Supporting Africa's Industrialization, the Plan for China Supporting Africa's Agricultural Modernization, and the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, and will work together to implement these initiatives and plans for common development and prosperity.
1.4 The two sides highly commend the mutual support and assistance to each other during the COVID pandemic and the success of the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19, which have set an example for the global response and added a new chapter in the China-Africa community with a shared future. China appreciates the support extended by Africa towards its COVID response. The African side commends China for providing Africa with important support and anti-COVID assistance.
1.5 The two sides speak highly of China-Africa relations which have entered the new era of building a high-level China-Africa community with a shared future. The two sides pledge to remain guided by and uphold openness and inclusiveness in developing China-Africa relations. China will not interfere in African countries' exploration of development paths that fit their national conditions; China will not interfere in African countries' internal affairs; China will not impose its will on African countries; China will not attach political strings to assistance to Africa; and China will not seek unilateral political gains in investment and financing cooperation with Africa. The two sides will always uphold the spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation, and foster an even stronger comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership between China and Africa.
1.6 The two sides fully recognize their leaders' advocacy of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and of pursuing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI), the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI), as well as Agenda 2063 of the African Union and its Second Ten Year Implementation Plan and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The two sides will work with countries across the world, according to international laws, to promote the global governance characterized by extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, build a new type of international relations, practice humanity's common values, and contribute to an open, inclusive, clean and pleasant world of lasting peace, universal security and shared prosperity.
1.7 The two sides see Africa as an important partner in Belt and Road cooperation. Inspired by the Silk Road and AU's 2063 Agenda spirit of peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning, and mutual benefit as well as the principle of planning, building and benefiting together, the two sides undertake to strengthen synergy between the Belt and Road cooperation and the Agenda 2063 of the African Union, especially the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations and the respective development strategies of African countries, and make greater contribution to international cooperation, global economic growth and the accelerated implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
1.8 China commends Africa's efforts to seek strength through unity, and accelerate integration in response to various risks and challenges. The two sides are convinced that the development of China and Africa will present more opportunities to human development, collective security and respect for each other's civilization. The two sides pledge to strengthen cooperation on the abovementioned initiatives and speak with one voice on issues of common interest to developing countries, and jointly call for an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.
1.9 The two sides share the view that the world is experiencing unprecedented and historical changes. The robust growth of the Global South represented by China and Africa is shaping the trajectory of the world history in a profound way. The two sides always stand in solidarity with other developing countries, uphold independence, actively promote South-South and triangular cooperation, oppose ideology-based bloc confrontation, and safeguard the common interests of the Global South in the ongoing reform of global governance system. The two sides support each other in safeguarding their sovereignty, security and development interests. The African side adheres to the one-China principle and is ready to provide firm support to China on issues relating to its core interests and major concerns.
1.10 The two sides take the view that China, the biggest developing country, is committed to pursuing higher-standard opening up to advance high-quality development, and is endeavoring to build itself into a stronger country and rejuvenate the Chinese nation in all respects by pursuing Chinese modernization. The African side speaks highly of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held in July this year, and believes that the systematic plans drawn up at the session for further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization will bring more opportunities for countries around the world, including African countries.

10.3.6 The two sides will continue to enhance exchanges and cooperation in the field of film, hold workshops for young professionals in Africa's film industry, support each other in hosting international film festivals, and introduce more Chinese and African films into each other's market.
11. FOCAC INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
11.1 The two sides are satisfied with the efficient and smooth operation of the Coordinators' Meeting on the Implementation of the Follow-Up Actions of the Eighth Ministerial Conference of FOCAC, the Senior Official Meetings (SOMs), and consultations between the Chinese Follow-up Committee of FOCAC and the African diplomatic corps in China. The two sides will continue to leverage the role of existing sub-forums under FOCAC, and further substantiate and institutionalize FOCAC.
11.2 The two sides encourage African members of FOCAC to strengthen connections with African Group of Ambassadors in China, which is an integral part of the Follow-up mechanism of FOCAC, in order to report progress on FOCAC outcomes.
11.3 In accordance with the procedures of the FOCAC follow-up mechanism, the two sides decide to hold the 10th Ministerial Conference in the Republic of the Congo in 2027, and, before that, the 18th and the 19th SOM in 2026 and 2027 respectively.
11.4 Based on the principle of equal rotation among regions within the AU, and considering that all African sub-regions have had countries as African Co-Chair of FOCAC for six years with the exception of central Africa, the two sides have agreed to arrange for two central African countries to hold the post in succession in the next six years. From the 11th Ministerial Conference of FOCAC in 2030 onward, the term of each African Co-Chair of FOCAC will be shortened from six years to three years. We welcome the Republic of the Congo as the co-chair of FOCAC from 2024 to 2027 and the Republic of Equatorial Guinea as the co-chair from 2027 to 2030.

China Wants to Raise Its Retirement Age. A Pension Crisis Looms.
: Brown, Tanner. 
: China's economy and society face myriad problems, and the Communist Party stoked one of them recently when it called for raising the retirement age.
The announcement seemed to accomplish the feat of angering everyone from college students to soon-to-be retirees.
"I work like a dog every day. I deserve to have time to rest early in my elder years," wrote one user on China's hottest social-media app, Xiaohongshu, which means Little Red Book.
The sentiment was echoed by those much nearer retirement. "I tell you this: If they raise the [retirement] age just before I'm supposed to finish my career, I won't stand for it," 58-year-old Li Zhong, who works at a traditional Chinese medicine company in Shanghai, told Barron's by phone.
At the Party's most important meeting of the year , which took place just weeks ago, the retirement announcement stood out among an array of policy proposals for China's faltering economy.
"In accordance with the principles of voluntariness and flexibility, we will steadily and orderly advance reform of progressively delaying the statutory retirement age," officials said at the conclusion of the meeting.
China's retirement conundrum is particularly sensitive for a number of reasons. For one, the retirement ages have long been relatively low: 50 for female blue-collar workers, 55 for female white-collar employees, and 60 for all males. For comparison, to receive full social security-type benefits in the European Union and the U.S., the age for both genders is 67.
Officials at the meeting didn't provide details on the proposed changes, but the leading government think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), projected in a recent report that men and women will retire at 65, possibly as early as five years from now.
Yet China's society is growing old at breakneck speed, meaning a small number of young people in the workforce will need to support a disproportionately large group of retirees. And nearly every demographer—including those within the Chinese government—agree that the math doesn't add up for giving upcoming retirees their promised benefits.
Within the next generation, more than 500 million people, or nearly 40% of the population, will be older than 60, according to government statistics. CASS estimates the public pension system will run dry within the next decade.
The young retirement age for women is a holdover from the 1950s days of Mao Zedong, when women worked in factories and had to care for children. So this gender disparity served as a relief of burden for them.
"But if we look at it from a modern perspective, this may be a discriminatory policy," said Sabrina Luk, an assistant professor of social sciences at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, noting that women in China live on average nearly six years longer than men.
"It doesn't make sense to ask women to retire earlier because they may have financial difficulties in old age, if they retire too early, unless they have other sources of finance to support them," she told Barron's.
Besides concerns about pensions drying up, other nest eggs are in jeopardy. China's housing crash, which began in 2021 and is ongoing, is draining billions of dollars of savings from middle-class families , who put most of their extra cash into real estate.
A range of unknowns face policymakers if and when they raise the retirement age, which on its own won't solve the pension crisis, said Luk. Another important factor: whether the age for men and women should be unified.
Perhaps more difficult to solve, even though China's fertility rate is plummeting below replacement levels, is the massive unemployment crisis for young Chinese. Millions of highly educated young Chinese have had to choose between taking blue-collar jobs or dropping out of the workforce altogether, both of which have been happening for years.
Barron's spoke with a range of young and older Chinese about the retirement issue and, although the overwhelming attitude was against the move, some took more measured views.
"The elderly now can drink and eat meat and travel around the world with pensions. But the elderly in the future may only be able to eat steamed buns with pensions," said Wu Jiapeng, a 35-year-old computer programmer in Beijing who is pessimistic that raising the age would alone solve the problem.
"If you want to live a good old age in the future, you can't rely on pensions, you can only rely on yourself," he said.

Forging stronger ties: President Xi's vision for China and Tajikistan
: Xi Jinping, the President of the People's Republic of China, before his third visit to the Tajikistan highlighted the growing relationship between China and Tajikistan. This visit comes at a time when both countries are commemorating over three decades of diplomatic relations, a period marked by deepening cooperation and mutual respect. Xi Jinping emphasized the historical ties between China and Tajikistan, dating back to the ancient Silk Road era. The enduring friendship has seen the two nations evolve from neighbors to strategic partners, fostering a comprehensive relationship built on shared values and mutual interests. The President reflected on the rich cultural exchanges that have historically linked the two nations, from the Han and Tang dynasties to the vibrant trade facilitated by Sogdian merchants.

China: Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Deepening Reform Comprehensively to Advance Chinese Modernization
: In order to implement the strategic plans made at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the 20th CPC Central Committee studied the issue of further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization at its third plenary session. On this basis, it adopted this resolution.
I. Great Significance and Overall Requirements
(1) Importance and necessity
Reform and opening up have been crucial to the cause of the Party and the people, enabling us to catch up with the times in great strides. The third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee was a landmark event that ushered in a new period: one of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. The third plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee was also of epoch-making significance. It marked the start of a new journey of comprehensively deepening reform in the new era with systematic and holistic plans, thus paving the way for a brand new stage in China's reform and opening up endeavors.
The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has, with great historical initiative, tremendous political courage, and a strong sense of mission, united and led the entire Party, the military, and Chinese people of all ethnic groups in unshackling their thinking and breaking down the barriers erected by vested interests. We have dared to brave uncharted waters, grapple with tough problems, and navigate potential dangers and have worked resolutely to remove institutional obstacles in all areas. As a result, reform has evolved from a variety of trials and breakthroughs limited to certain areas into an integrated drive being advanced across the board. Foundational institutional frameworks have been basically put in place in all sectors, and historic, systemic, and holistic transformations have been achieved in many fields. Overall, we have accomplished the reform tasks set at the third plenary session of the 18th Central Committee and attained our objective of achieving marked results in making all institutions more mature and better-defined by the time of the Party's centennial in 2021. All this has provided strong institutional support for completing the First Centenary Goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and set China on a new journey toward building a modern socialist country in all respects.
The present and the near future constitute a critical period for our endeavor to build a great country and move toward national rejuvenation on all fronts through Chinese modernization. As Chinese modernization has been advanced continuously through reform and opening up, it will surely embrace broader horizons through further reform and opening up. To deal with complex developments both at home and abroad, adapt to the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and live up to the new expectations of our people, it is vital that we continue to advance reform. Advancing reform is essential for upholding and improving the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernizing China's system and capacity for governance, for putting the new development philosophy into practice and better adapting to the evolution in the principal contradiction in Chinese society, and for adhering to a people-centered approach to see that the gains of modernization benefit all our people fairly. It is also crucial for responding to major risks and challenges and ensuring steady and sustained progress in the cause of the Party and the country, for promoting the development of a human community with a shared future and winning the strategic initiative amid accelerating global changes of a like not seen in a century, and for further advancing the great new project of Party building in the new era and making our Marxist party stronger. Reform and opening up are an ongoing endeavor rather than a task to be completed. All of us in the Party must consciously give more prominence to reform and further deepen reform comprehensively with a view to advancing Chinese modernization.
(2) Guiding philosophy
We must stay committed to Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development and fully implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. We must thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's new ideas, viewpoints, and conclusions on comprehensively deepening reform and fully and faithfully apply the new development philosophy on all fronts. We must adhere to the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability and continue to free our minds, seek truth from facts, move with the times, and take a realistic and pragmatic approach, as we work to further unleash and develop the productive forces and tap into and boost the vitality of our society. Keeping in mind both domestic and international imperatives, we will ensure coordinated implementation of the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy. Regarding economic structural reform as the spearhead and greater social fairness and justice and increased wellbeing of the people as our ultimate objectives, we will channel greater energy into making our reforms integrated, focused, and effective. We will work to better adapt the relations of production to the productive forces, the superstructure to the economic base, and national governance to social development so as to provide strong impetus and institutional support for Chinese modernization.
(3) Overall objectives
We will continue to improve and develop the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernize China's system and capacity for governance. By 2035, we will have finished building a high-standard socialist market economy in all respects, further improved the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, generally modernized our system and capacity for governance, and basically realized socialist modernization. All of this will lay a solid foundation for building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects by the middle of this century. In particular, we will focus on achieving the following objectives:
-Building a high-standard socialist market economy. We will see that the market plays the decisive role in resource allocation and that the government better fulfills its role. We will uphold and improve China's basic socialist economic systems, achieve greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, and promote high-standard opening up. We will build a modernized economy, move faster to create a new pattern of development, and promote high-quality development.
-Advancing whole-process people's democracy. We will uphold the unity between leadership by the Party, the running of the country by the people, and law-based governance. We will improve the institutions through which the people run the country, promote extensive, multilevel, and institutionalized development of consultative democracy, and refine the system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics. We will move to a higher stage in building a socialist country under the rule of law.
-Developing a strong socialist culture in China. We will uphold the foundational system for ensuring the guiding role of Marxism in the ideological domain and improve the institutions and mechanisms for developing cultural programs and industries. We will promote cultural prosperity, enrich the intellectual and cultural lives of our people, and enhance China's cultural soft power and the appeal of Chinese culture.
-Improving the people's quality of life. We will refine the income distribution, employment, and social security systems, make basic public services more balanced and accessible, and facilitate more notable, substantive progress in promoting people's well-rounded development and common prosperity for all.
-Building a Beautiful China. We will ramp up the green transition in all areas of economic and social development and improve the environmental governance system. We will prioritize ecological protection, conserve resources and use them efficiently, and pursue green and low-carbon development, with a view to promoting harmony between humanity and nature.
-Advancing the Peaceful China Initiative to a higher level. We will strengthen the national security system, enhance integration between national strategies, and improve our capacity to safeguard national security. We will create new institutions, mechanisms, and methods for social governance and build a new security architecture.
-Improving the Party's capacity for leadership and long-term governance. We will develop new and improved ways of exercising leadership and governance, deepen institutional reforms related to Party building, and improve the system for exercising full and rigorous Party self-governance.
The reform tasks laid out in this resolution shall be completed by the time the People's Republic of China celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2029.
(4) Guiding principles
On the basis of reviewing and applying the valuable experience we have gained since the launch of reform and opening up, particularly from our endeavor to comprehensively deepen reform in the new era, we will implement the following principles:
- Upholding the Party's overall leadership. We must firmly uphold the Central Committee's authority and its centralized, unified leadership and ensure that the Party fulfills its core role of exercising overall leadership and coordinating the efforts of all sides. We must ensure that Party leadership is exercised in every aspect and throughout the entire process of reform so that it always advances in the correct political direction.
- Adhering to a people-centered approach. We must respect the principal position and pioneering spirit of the people and make our reform measures highly responsive to the call of the people, so as to ensure that reform is for the people and by the people and that its fruits are shared among the people.
- Upholding fundamental principles and breaking new ground. Staying committed to socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must keep pace with the times, adapt to the evolution of practice, and take a problem-oriented approach, so that from a new starting point, we can promote innovations in theory and practice, in our institutions and culture, and in all other aspects.
- Strengthening institutional building as our main task. We must strengthen top-level design and overall planning, always establishing new systems before abolishing old ones while attaching equal importance to efforts in both respects. We must consolidate foundational systems, refine basic systems, and innovate important systems.
- Staying committed to law-based governance on all fronts. We must deepen reform and advance Chinese modernization under the rule of law and ensure unity between reform and the rule of law, seeing that all major reforms have a solid legal basis and that reform achievements are elevated to law in a timely manner.
- Applying systems thinking. We must properly handle the major relationships between the economy and society, between the government and the market, between efficiency and fairness, between vitality and order, and between development and security, thus pursuing reform in a more systematic, holistic, and coordinated manner.
II. Building a High-Standard Socialist Market Economy
A high-standard socialist market economy provides an important guarantee for Chinese modernization. We must better leverage the role of the market, foster a fairer and more dynamic market environment, and make resource allocation as efficient and productive as possible. We need to lift restrictions on the market while ensuring effective regulation and strive to better maintain order in the market and remedy market failures. By doing so, we will ensure smooth flows in the national economy and unleash the internal driving forces and creativity of the whole of society.
(5) Upholding and fulfilling the commitments to the public and non-public sectors
We will stay committed to unswervingly consolidating and developing the public sector and unswervingly encouraging, supporting, and guiding the development of the non-public sector. We will ensure that economic entities under all forms of ownership have equal access to factors of production in accordance with the law, compete in the market on an equal footing, and are protected by the law as equals, thus enabling them to complement each other and develop side by side.
We will deepen reform of state capital and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), improving the institutions and mechanisms for management and oversight, strengthening strategic coordination between relevant administrative departments, and working to refine the layout of the state-owned sector and adjust its structure. All this will help state capital and SOEs get stronger, do better, and grow bigger, with their core functions and core competitiveness enhanced. We will clearly define the functions of different types of SOEs, improve the management of their primary responsibilities and core business, and identify the key areas and orientations for state capital investment. State capital will be steered toward major industries and key fields that are vital to national security and serve as the lifeblood of the national economy, toward sectors such as public services, emergency response, and public welfare, which concern our country's prosperity and our people's wellbeing, and toward forward-looking and strategic emerging industries. The institutional framework under which SOEs pursue original innovation will be improved, and the reform of state capital investment and operation companies will be continued. We will establish a system to assess SOEs' performance in fulfilling their strategic missions, refine the category-based SOE evaluation system, and introduce value-added accounting in the state-owned sector. While promoting independent operation of natural monopoly businesses in sectors such as energy, railway, telecommunications, water conservancy, and public utilities, we will advance market-oriented reforms in the competitive areas of these sectors and improve regulatory institutions and mechanisms.
We will continue to implement principles and policies that help foster a favorable environment and create more opportunities for the development of the non-public sector. We will formulate a private sector promotion law. We will do more to remove barriers to market access, work to see that the competitive areas of infrastructure are open to market entities in a fair manner, and improve the long-term mechanism by which private enterprises participate in major national projects. We will support capable private enterprises in leading national initiatives to make breakthroughs in major technologies and provide private enterprises with greater access to major national scientific research infrastructure. We will refine financing support policies and systems for private enterprises to resolve the difficulties they face in accessing affordable financing. We will improve the legal framework for the long-term regulation of charges levied on enterprises and for clearing overdue payments owed to them. We will move faster to set up a system for comprehensively evaluating private enterprises' credit status and refine the credit enhancement system for small and medium private enterprises. We will support and guide private enterprises in improving their governance structures and management systems, building up compliance capacity, and better preventing corruption-related risks. We will strengthen ongoing and ex post oversight and regulate administrative inspections on private enterprises.
We will refine the modern corporate system with distinctive Chinese features and promote entrepreneurial spirit. We will support and guide enterprises of all types as they work to use resources and production factors more efficiently, improve their operation and management, and fulfill their social responsibilities. Efforts will be accelerated to foster a greater number of world-class enterprises.
(6) Building a unified national market
We will work to see that the underlying institutions and rules of the market are unified, that market regulation is exercised in an impartial and unified manner, and that connectivity between market facilities is built to high standards. We will enhance the binding force of fair competition review, take stronger action against monopolies and unfair competition, and review and abolish regulations and practices that impede the development of a unified national market and fair competition. We will bring local regulations and institutions for attracting investment under regulation and strictly prohibit policy incentives in breach of laws and regulations. We will establish sound, unified, and well-regulated public resource trading platforms that facilitate information sharing. Such platforms will cover public bidding as well as procurement by the government, public institutions, and SOEs and ensure full transparency throughout the project management process. Overall market regulation capabilities will be enhanced. We will refine the national system of standards and deepen reform of local systems for standards management.
The institutions and rules for production factor markets will be improved to facilitate the smooth flow of production factors, the efficient allocation of all types of resources, and the full realization of market potential. We will develop a unified market for urban and rural land designated for construction. We will refine the underlying systems for promoting well-regulated development of the capital market and foster an integrated national market for technology and data. By refining the mechanisms whereby production factors are priced primarily based on market supply and demand, we will prevent improper government interference in pricing. We will also develop better mechanisms to ensure the contributions of production factors, such as labor, capital, land, knowledge, technology, management, and data, are determined by the market and rewarded accordingly. Pricing reforms will be continued in sectors such as water, energy, and transportation, and the tiered pricing mechanisms for household water, electricity, and natural gas consumption will be improved, as will the pricing mechanism for refined petroleum products.
We will improve the commodity distribution system, speed up the development of the Internet of Things, and further refine the integrated framework of distribution rules and standards to cut logistics costs throughout society. We will deepen reform of the energy management system, build a unified national electricity market, and improve the operation and coordination mechanisms for oil and gas pipelines.
We will step up efforts to develop a complete domestic demand system. To this end, we will set up long-term government investment mechanisms to support the development of major projects that are of fundamental and far-reaching importance and serve the public interest; refine the institutions and mechanisms that enable government investment to effectively drive nongovernmental investment; further reform the investment review and approval system; improve the mechanisms for stimulating and facilitating nongovernmental investment; and create a market-driven mechanism for ensuring self-sustaining growth of effective investment. We will refine long-term mechanisms for expanding consumption, reduce relevant restrictions, boost public spending as necessary, and actively promote the debut economy.
(7) Refining the systems underpinning the market economy
We will improve the property rights system to ensure law-based, equitable protection of the property rights of economic entities under all forms of ownership on a long-term basis and establish an efficient system for the comprehensive management of intellectual property rights. We will refine the market information disclosure system and put in place a commercial secrets protection system.

We will see that basic research is conducted in a better organized way, raise the share of total science and technology expenditure that goes toward basic research, and improve the basic research investment mechanisms to ensure support on both a competitive and ongoing basis. Regions, enterprises, social organizations, and individuals with the resources to support basic research will be encouraged to do so. We will also support researchers in diversifying their subjects for study and encourage high-risk, high-reward basic research. We will advance reform of the science and technology evaluation system, ensure that ethical standards are adhered to, and rectify academic misconduct.
Reinforcing the principal role of enterprises in innovation, we will establish mechanisms for fostering leading high-tech enterprises and strengthen enterprise-led collaboration between industries, universities, and research institutes. We will set up a reserve fund system for corporate R&D and back enterprises that volunteer to lead or participate in major national science and technology programs. Mechanisms will be rolled out to promote the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that use specialized and sophisticated technologies to produce novel and unique products. To encourage sci-tech SMEs to boost their R&D spending, we will raise the rate of additional tax deductions for their R&D expenses. We will encourage and guide higher education institutions and research institutes in authorizing the use of their proprietary scientific and technological advances by micro, small, and medium enterprises on a use first, pay later basis.
We will refine the mechanisms for allocation, management, and utilization of central government research funds and improve the institutions for the implementation of central government-funded science and technology programs and their management by specialized agencies. We will expand application of the contract system for government-funded research projects and grant scientists a greater say in deciding on technology roadmaps, spending funds, and allocating resources. We will establish a mechanism for adopting non-consensus projects based on real-name recommendations by experts. Public institutions engaged in scientific research will be allowed to implement a more flexible management system as compared to general public institutions, so that they can explore approaches to instituting corporate management.
We will further reform the mechanisms for applying scientific and technological advances. We will enhance the national technology transfer system, move faster to plan and build a number of proof-of-concept and pilot-scale testing platforms, refine the policies for the initial application of newly-developed equipment, materials, and software, and increase government procurement of independently innovated products. The pool of technology managers will be expanded.

Relevant systems will be refined to ensure that researchers can concentrate on research.
We will enhance the incentive mechanisms for talent, granting more say to employers and creating a more accommodating environment for talent development. We will put in place a personnel assessment system based on innovation-related capability, performance, outcomes, and contributions. We will open up channels to enable flows of personnel between universities and research institutes on the one hand and enterprises on the other. We will improve the support mechanisms for recruiting talent from overseas and create internationally competitive personnel systems. We will also explore avenues for establishing an immigration system for highly-skilled personnel.
V. Improving Macroeconomic Governance
Sound macro regulation, along with effective governance by the government, is essential for ensuring that we can fully leverage the institutional strengths of our socialist market economy. It is, therefore, vital that we improve our macro regulation systems. We must pursue coordinated reforms in the fiscal, tax, financial, and other major sectors and work to enhance the consistency of macro policy orientation.
(16) Improving the national strategic planning system and policy coordination mechanisms
We will develop mechanisms for formulating and executing national strategies and make a stronger push to fully integrate all major strategies, so that they can provide better macro guidance and overall coordination. The systems for national economic and social development planning will be improved. This will see us enhancing the mechanisms for the alignment and implementation of plans, better harnessing the strategic guiding role of national development plans, bolstering the basic role of territorial space plans, and reinforcing the supporting role of subject-specific plans and regional plans. We will also improve the system by which experts participate in decision-making on public issues.
To promote the implementation of national development plans and major strategies, we will foster greater synergy between our fiscal, monetary, industrial, pricing, and employment policies, improving the allocation of newly acquired resources and adjusting the mix of existing resources. We will explore the introduction of national macro balance sheet management. Both economic and non-economic policies will be evaluated to ensure that they are consistent with the macro policy orientation. The expectations management mechanism will be improved. We will refine the statistical indicators accounting system to better support high-quality development, expanding the coverage of statistics to include more new forms of economy and new sectors. We will promote the development of statistical infrastructure for industrial entities, optimize statistical methods for both headquarters and branches, and gradually work toward compiling statistics based on the places where market entities conduct their business activities. Steps will be taken to improve the mechanisms for international coordination on macro policies.
(17) Deepening reform of the fiscal and tax systems
We will further improve the budget system and strengthen unified management of all fiscal resources and budgets. All revenues generated on the basis of the exercise of administrative power, government credit, and state-owned resources and assets will be placed under government budget management. We will improve the budgeting and performance assessment systems for state capital operations and strengthen fiscal support for major national strategic tasks and basic public wellbeing. We will enhance macro guidance on budgeting and fiscal policies. We will strengthen performance management for public services, with a focus on conducting ex ante evaluations of their functions. Reforms for zero-based budgeting will be advanced. We will unify budget allocation powers, make budget management more unified and standardized, and take steps to boost budget transparency and enhance budget oversight. We will improve the system for comprehensive government financial reporting based on accrual accounting.
The tax structure will be improved to make taxation systems more conducive to high-quality development, social fairness, and the building of a unified market. We will also look into approaches for better adapting these systems to new forms of business. Fully implementing the principle of legality of taxation, we will regulate policies on tax breaks and improve the support mechanisms for key sectors and links. We will refine the system of direct taxes, improve the personal income tax system which is based on both adjusted gross income and specific income types, regulate taxation policies on incomes generated from business operations, capital, and property, and unify tax rates for incomes earned through work. Reform of the tax collection and administration system will be deepened.
We will establish a fiscal relationship between the central and local governments that features well-defined powers and responsibilities and the appropriate allocation of resources, with an optimum balance between regions. To place more fiscal resources at the disposal of local governments, we will expand the sources of tax revenue at the local level and grant greater authority for tax management to local governments as appropriate. To improve the system of transfer payments, we will overhaul special transfer payments and increase the scale of general transfer payments. These will help ensure that the fiscal resources of prefecture- and county-level governments are commensurate with their powers. We will establish incentive and constraint mechanisms through transfer payments to promote high-quality development. We will take steps to move excise tax collection further down the production-to-consumption chain, with the power of collection steadily being passed to local governments. We will improve the value-added tax credit refund policy and free up the channels for making tax deductions. The ratio for taxes shared between the central and local governments will be optimized. We will look into rolling the urban maintenance and construction tax, education surcharges, and local education surcharges into one single local surtax. Local governments will have the authority to set the rate for this tax within a predetermined range. We will appropriately expand the scope of use for funds raised from the sale of local government special-purpose bonds, permitting a greater share of such funds to be used as capital in more sectors and on a larger scale. The systems for managing government debt will be improved. We will establish a system for monitoring and regulating all local government debt as well as long-term mechanisms for preventing and defusing hidden debt risks. We will move faster to reform and transform local government financing platforms. In regulating the management of non-tax revenue, we will delegate, as appropriate, some management authority to local governments and allow them to tailor their practices to local conditions.
The central government will hold more fiscal powers as appropriate and raise the proportion of central government expenditure accordingly. In principle, the expenditures commensurate with such powers should be allocated from the central government, and such powers to be delegated to local governments should be reduced. No requirements for supporting funds from local governments in violation of regulations shall be made. When it is necessary to delegate fiscal powers to local governments, the relevant funds should be arranged through special transfer payments.
(18) Deepening reform of the financial system
We will move faster to improve the central bank system and the monetary policy transmission mechanism. We will actively develop technology finance, green finance, inclusive finance, pension finance, and digital finance and work to ensure quality financial services for major strategies, key fields, and weak links. We will refine the role and governance of financial institutions and the incentive and constraint mechanisms for ensuring that they serve the real economy. We will diversify equity financing, step up the development of multilevel bond markets, and increase the proportion of direct financing. We will optimize the state-owned financial capital management system.
We will improve the functions of the capital market to give balanced weight to investment and financing. We will prevent risks and tighten regulation to promote the sound and stable development of the capital market. We will facilitate the entry of long-term capital into the market. We will improve the overall quality of listed companies, strengthen relevant regulation and delisting systems, and establish long-term mechanisms to enhance the underlying stability of the capital market.

We will optimize dividend incentive and constraint mechanisms for listed companies and improve the mechanisms for protecting investors. We will encourage regional equity markets to align their rules and implement unified standards.
A financial law will be formulated. We will improve the financial regulatory system to ensure that all financial activities are placed under regulation in accordance with the law, strengthen regulatory responsibility and accountability systems, and improve regulatory coordination between the central and local levels. We will build secure and efficient financial infrastructure, unify the rules and systems for registration, custody, settlement, and liquidation for the financial market, establish binding constraints for defusing risks at an early stage, and build a robust system to effectively fend off and control systemic risks and ensure financial stability. We will improve the mechanisms for protecting financial consumers and cracking down on illegal financial activities and establish a firewall for industrial and financial capital. We will promote high-standard opening up of the financial sector, steadily and prudently advance the internationalization of the RMB, and develop offshore RMB markets. We will make steady progress in the R&D and application of digital RMB and move faster to build Shanghai into an international financial center.
We will improve the management model based on pre-establishment national treatment plus a negative list and support qualified foreign capital institutions in participating in our financial service trials. We will expand the connectivity between domestic and overseas financial markets in a steady and prudent way and improve the qualified foreign institutional investor system. We will push forward the development of a homegrown, controllable cross-border payment system and strengthen financial security mechanisms as we open our doors wider to the outside world. We will establish a system for the unified monitoring and oversight of all foreign debt. We will actively participate in international financial governance.
(19) Improving mechanisms for implementing the coordinated regional development strategy
We will develop a regional economic layout and a territorial space system characterized by complementarity between different regions and territorial spaces. We will improve the institutional and policy frameworks for opening up a new vista in the large-scale development of the western region, achieving new breakthroughs in the full revitalization of the Northeast, accelerating the rise of the central region, and encouraging the eastern region to modernize more quickly.

We will improve the system of institutions for functional zoning and strengthen mechanisms to support optimal development of territorial spaces. We will improve integrated regional development mechanisms, build new mechanisms for cooperative development across administrative divisions, and deepen industrial collaboration between the eastern, central, and western regions. The institutions and mechanisms for promoting the development of the marine economy will be enhanced.
VI. Promoting Integrated Urban-Rural Development
Integrated urban and rural development is essential to Chinese modernization. We must pursue coordinated progress in new industrialization, new urbanization, and all-around rural revitalization, facilitate greater urban-rural integration in planning, development, and governance across the board, and promote equal exchanges and two-way flows of production factors between urban and rural areas, so as to narrow the disparities between the two and promote their shared prosperity and development.
(20) Improving the institutions and mechanisms for advancing new urbanization
We will put in place mechanisms to foster positive interactions between the processes of industrial upgrading, population concentration, and urban development. We will implement the systems for allowing people to obtain household registration and access basic public services in their place of permanent residence. We will push to see that eligible people who have moved to cities from rural areas enjoy the same rights as registered local residents with regard to social insurance, housing support, and access to compulsory education for their children living with them. The process of granting permanent urban residency to these people will also be accelerated. We will protect the lawful land rights and interests of former rural residents who now hold permanent urban residency, protect, in accordance with the law, their rights to contract rural land, to use their rural residential land, and to share in the proceeds from rural collective undertakings, and explore avenues to facilitate voluntary, paid transfers of these rights.
We will continue to follow the principle that cities should be built by the people and for the people. We will improve urban planning to see that cities of different sizes and small towns develop in coordination with each other to form efficient and closely knit layouts. We will deepen reform of the urban development, operation, and governance systems and step up efforts to change the development models of cities. We will work to create new systems for smart and efficient governance in super-large and mega cities and establish institutions and mechanisms for the highly-integrated development of cities in metropolitan areas. We will deepen reforms to grant super-large towns economic and social management rights that are commensurate with their populations and economic sizes. We will develop sustainable urban renewal models, along with relevant policies and regulations, and strengthen the building of underground utility tunnels and the upgrading of old pipelines. These efforts will help make our cities safer and more resilient.
(21) Consolidating and improving the basic rural operation system
We will move forward with well-organized trials to extend rural land contracts by another 30 years upon the expiration of the second-round contracts, deepen the reform to separate the ownership rights, contract rights, and management rights of contracted land, and develop appropriately scaled agricultural operations. We will improve the framework for agricultural operations and refine the pricing mechanism for the transfer of contracted land management rights. We will encourage farmers to engage in cooperative operations and see that our policies for supporting new types of agribusiness serve to increase rural incomes. We will develop a system of convenient and efficient commercial agricultural services. We will develop new types of rural collective economies, establish related operating mechanisms featuring clearly defined property rights and rational income distribution, and ensure that farmers enjoy more adequate property rights and interests.
(22) Improving supporting systems to strengthen agriculture, benefit farmers, and enrich rural areas
Continuing to prioritize agricultural and rural development, we will improve the investment mechanisms for rural revitalization. We will work to expand county industries that benefit local people, build a diversified food supply system, and foster new industries and new forms of business in rural areas. We will optimize the system of agricultural subsidy policies and develop multi-tiered agricultural insurance schemes. We will refine the regular mechanisms for preventing rural residents from lapsing or relapsing into poverty and establish a system of multi-tiered and categorized support for low-income rural residents and underdeveloped areas. We will improve the long-term mechanisms for managing assets formed with government inputs in the process of poverty alleviation. Applying the experience gained from the Green Rural Revival Program in Zhejiang Province, we will refine the long-term mechanisms for promoting all-around rural revitalization.
We will work faster to improve the mechanisms for ensuring the incomes of grain growers and see that the prices of grain and other major agricultural products remain at a reasonable level. We will coordinate efforts to establish an inter-provincial mechanism for major grain-purchasing areas to compensate major grain-producing areas so as to make substantive headway in incentivizing the latter. We will make coordinated progress in reforming the institutions and mechanisms related to the purchase and sale of grain and the management of grain reserves and develop new regulatory models in this regard. The long-term mechanisms for conserving grain and other types of food will be improved.
(23) Deepening reform of the land system
We will reform and refine the system for offsetting cultivated land that has been put to other uses, manage all types of arable land occupation in a unified manner, and improve the acceptance inspection mechanism to make sure that newly-added arable land is of an equivalent quantity and quality. We will improve the mechanisms for developing, verifying, managing, and protecting high-standard cropland. We will refine the management system for ensuring that arable land is used for planting basic crops. We will allow rural households to put houses under their legal ownership to good use by leasing them out, contributing them in the form of shares, and engaging in cooperative ventures. We will promote orderly reforms for market-based transfers of rural collective land designated for business construction and improve the mechanisms for distributing returns realized from the appreciation of land.
We will optimize land management, refining relevant systems so that they are efficiently aligned with macro policies and regional development needs. We will give priority to the reasonable land needs of leading industries and major projects, with a view to creating greater development space for regions with competitive edge. We will establish a coordination mechanism to link increases in urban construction land quotas for cities with the growth of their permanent residents. We will explore mechanisms for using contiguous land that has been reclaimed and upgraded by the government to offset arable land being used by specific projects and regions. We will optimize land use for urban industry and commerce and accelerate the development of the secondary market for construction land. We will promote mixed land development and use and allow for changes in land use purposes when appropriate, ensuring that idle and inefficiently used land can be put to better use. Targeted steps will be taken to address land use problems in various types of industrial parks. Policies will be formulated for extending land use rights for industrial and commercial purposes and for renewing them upon expiration.
VII. Pursuing High-Standard Opening Up
Opening up is a defining feature of Chinese modernization. We must remain committed to the basic state policy of opening to the outside world and continue to promote reform through opening up. Leveraging the strengths of China's enormous market, we will enhance our capacity for opening up while expanding international cooperation and develop new institutions for a higher-standard open economy.
(24) Steadily expanding institutional opening up
We will promote alignment with high-standard international economic and trade rules and harmonize rules, regulations, management, and standards relating to property rights protection, industrial subsidies, environmental standards, labor protection, government procurement, e-commerce, the financial sector, and other areas, in an effort to create an institutional environment that is transparent, stable, and predictable. We will seize the initiative by opening China's commodity, services, capital, and labor markets wider to the outside world in an orderly manner and unilaterally opening our doors wider to the world's least developed countries. We will further reform institutions and mechanisms for foreign aid to realize full-chain management.
We will safeguard the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, actively participate in the reform of global economic governance, and provide more global public goods. We will expand our globally-oriented network of high-standard free trade areas, establish compliance mechanisms that are aligned with prevailing international rules, and optimize the environment for opening up and cooperation.
(25) Deepening the foreign trade structural reform
We will better coordinate trade policies with fiscal, tax, financial, and industrial policies, create a set of systems and policies to support efforts to build China into a strong trading nation, step up reforms to integrate domestic and foreign trade, and actively respond to the trends of digital and green trade. We will develop new regulatory approaches for customs clearance, taxation, and foreign exchange and foster an institutional environment that is conducive to the development of new models and forms of trade. We will develop digital trade in an innovative manner and promote the development of integrated pilot zones for cross-border e-commerce. We will build commodity trading centers and global distribution centers, support various types of entities in developing logistics facilities overseas in a well-ordered way, and facilitate the development of international logistics hubs, as well as hubs for the distribution of commodities and resources, in areas where conditions allow. The mechanisms for preventing and controlling trade risks will be improved, and our export control framework and trade remedy system will be refined.
We will adopt innovative measures to boost trade in services and fully apply the negative list for cross-border trade in services. We will promote comprehensive trials and demonstrations for expanding opening up of the service sector and encourage specialized service organizations to enhance their capacity for providing international services. We will work faster to promote offshore trade and develop new types of transactions in offshore international trade. We will set up sound systems for cross-border financial services and diversify the supply of financial products and services.
(26) Further reforming the management systems for inward and outward investment
We will foster a first-rate business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized and protect the rights and interests of foreign investors in accordance with the law. We will expand the catalog of encouraged industries for foreign investment, appropriately shorten the negative list for foreign investment, remove all market access restrictions in the manufacturing sector, and promote wider opening with regard to telecommunications, the internet, education, culture, medical services, and other sectors in a well-conceived way. We will further reform the institutions and mechanisms for promoting foreign investment, ensure national treatment for foreign-funded enterprises in terms of access to factors of production, license application, standards setting, and government procurement, and support them in collaborating with upstream and downstream enterprises in industrial chains. We will improve relevant measures to make it more convenient for people from outside the mainland to live, receive medical services, and make payments on the mainland.

We must acquire a deep understanding of the decisive significance of establishing Comrade Xi Jinping's core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole and establishing the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. We must be more conscious of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment with the central Party leadership. We must stay confident in the path, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must uphold Comrade Xi Jinping's core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole and uphold the Central Committee's authority and its centralized, unified leadership.
We must maintain a keen awareness of the need to use the Party's self-reform to steer social reform and continue to apply both the spirit of reform and rigorous standards in conducting Party self-governance. We will improve the systems and regulations for the Party's self-reform and continue working to purify, improve, renew, and excel ourselves. All this will enable our Party to remain the strong leadership core in building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
(57) Upholding the Party Central Committee's centralized, unified leadership over the endeavor to further deepen reform comprehensively
The Party Central Committee exercises leadership over the general design, coordination, and overall advancement of all our reforms. We will refine the mechanisms through which the major decisions and plans of the Central Committee are implemented, in order to ensure full compliance with its orders and prohibitions. Party committees (leading Party members groups) at all levels are responsible for implementing the Central Committee's decisions and plans, planning and advancing reforms in their regions and departments, encouraging pioneering efforts and innovations based on their own situations, and creating new experience that can be applied elsewhere. Continuing to follow the Party's mass line in the new era, we will fully incorporate social expectations, the people's wisdom, the views of experts, and primary-level experience into the design of reforms. We will set reform agendas with a focus on solving prominent problems and improve the mechanisms for drawing up key reform plans. We will uphold truth, correct errors, and discover problems and remedy failings as they arise. We will improve reform incentives and better guide public opinion so as to foster a favorable environment for reform.
(58) Deepening institutional reforms related to Party building
With a focus on boosting the whole Party's drive, initiative, and creativity for reform and development, we will improve the systems and mechanisms for Party building. We will further arm ourselves with the Party's new theories and set up sound long-term mechanisms for reinforcing commitment, acquiring knowledge, improving conduct, and enhancing performance through learning. We will further reform the management system for officials and personnel and firmly follow the right approach to selecting and appointing officials. Officials who are politically committed, highly responsible, determined to pursue reform, outstanding in performance, and honest and clean, must be selected; and the problem of officials acting arbitrarily or lacking the willingness, courage, or ability to deliver must be addressed. We will see that officials have a correct understanding of what it means to perform well and improve the mechanisms for effectively preventing and correcting any misguided views about achievements. We will apply the three distinctions to encourage officials to forge ahead in a pioneering spirit and demonstrate enterprise in their work. We will make an ongoing effort to ensure that officials can be demoted as well as promoted and make a stronger push to replace those who are no longer suitable for their posts. We will improve the mechanisms for providing regular training, and basic training in particular, for officials, give them more professional training opportunities, and temper them through practice, in order to make them fully capable of advancing modernization initiatives. The tenure system for leading officials will be refined and fully applied, and the handover system for the heads of leadership teams will be improved. We will strengthen the political and organizational functions of Party organizations. We will look into effective ways of Party building in new types of economic and social organizations and among groups in new forms of employment. We will improve the mechanisms for guiding and managing Party members and giving full play to their roles. We will also refine Party rules and regulations, increase their authority, and fully enforce them.
(59) Intensifying efforts to improve conduct, build integrity, and combat corruption
Mechanisms for conducting concrete, targeted, and regular political oversight will be improved. We will steadfastly implement the central Party leadership's eight-point decision on improving conduct and refine our systems and mechanisms for preventing and tackling pointless formalities and bureaucratism. We will continue to streamline and standardize meetings and documents, as well as all types of demonstration initiatives, evaluations, standards inspections, festival celebrations, expositions and exhibitions, and forums; strictly control the total number of community-level inspections, examinations, and evaluations; and raise the quality of research and studies. Great effort will be made to address the excessive frequency of all these activities. We will formulate lists of duties for towns and townships (urban sub-districts) and refine the long-term mechanisms for reducing their burdens. We will set up mechanisms for carrying out regular and intensive education on Party discipline and better exercise four forms of oversight over discipline compliance, thus ensuring we make full use of Party discipline as a guide, restraint, guarantee, and incentive.
We will improve the mechanisms for coordinating efforts to ensure that officials do not have the audacity, opportunity, or desire to be corrupt and work hard to eradicate the breeding grounds and conditions for corruption. We will improve the mechanisms for investigating and addressing instances of both misconduct and corruption, intensify efforts to uproot corruption in sectors with a high concentration of power, funds, and resources, and strictly investigate and deal with any collusion between government officials and businesspeople that undermines the political ecosystem and economic development. We will refine the mechanisms for taking joint punitive actions against major bribe givers and adopt more measures to effectively prevent and control new and disguised forms of corruption. We will take stronger steps to handle false accusations. We will improve the mechanisms for pursuing fugitives, preventing escape, and retrieving stolen assets. We will see that a culture of integrity prevails in the new era.
Party and state oversight systems will be improved. We will ensure that principal and oversight responsibilities for full and rigorous Party self-governance are assumed. We will improve the supporting systems for more effective oversight of leadership teams and their heads. We will improve the mechanisms for applying checks over the allocation and exercise of power and oppose privilege-seeking mindsets and behavior. We will work to coordinate discipline and law enforcement with the administration of criminal justice. We will improve the working institutions and mechanisms for discipline inspection. We will optimize the functions of oversight, inspection, review, and investigation agencies, improve the discipline inspection and supervision systems for departments under vertical management, and work to see that discipline inspection and supervision teams are dispatched to all central government-administered enterprises. Institutional reforms for primary-level oversight will be deepened. Steps will be taken to advance national anti-corruption legislation, revise the Supervision Law, and formulate a law on countering transnational corruption.
(60) Ensuring the implementation of reforms with relentless perseverance
The whole Party must take pragmatic, resolute, and effective steps to ensure implementation of the Party Central Committee's decisions and plans on further deepening reform comprehensively. We need to work in concert from top to bottom across all departments and regions to set the tasks, timelines, and priorities for reform in a well-conceived way, and designate competent departments for implementing each reform initiative and clearly define their responsibilities. The implementation of major reforms will be subject to oversight and inspection, and the litmus test of reform will lie in how well it performs, what it delivers, and how much satisfaction it brings our people.
Chinese modernization is the modernization of peaceful development. In diplomatic work, China remains firm in pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace and is dedicated to promoting a human community with a shared future. We will stay committed to the common values of all humanity, pursue the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative, and call for an equal and orderly multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. We will deepen institutional reforms related to the work of foreign affairs and get involved in leading the reform and development of the global governance system. We will resolutely safeguard China's sovereignty, security, and development interests and foster a favorable external environment for further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization.
Let the whole Party, the entire military, and Chinese people of all ethnic groups rally more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core. Let us hold high the banner of reform and opening up, pool all wisdom and strength, and forge ahead with enterprise. Let us work hard toward the Second Centenary Goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and strive to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through Chinese modernization.

China: Vision and Conviction Will Take China-India Relations Forward--Speech at the Donation Ceremony of the Bronze Statue of Dr. Dwarkanath Shantaram Kotnis at the Camp No.1 High School of Solapur
: Dear teachers, students and friends:
Good morning!
It gives me great pleasure to join you at the Camp No.1 High School in Solapur. I just visited the Dr. Dwarkanath Shantaram Kotnis Memorial with my Indian friends. I am deeply touched by Dr. Kotnis' dedication of his best years and selfless love to China.
Eighty-six years ago, Dr. Kotnis went to China to support Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. He saved countless Chinese lives with his excellent medical skills, and trained many Chinese medical personnel. A friend in need is a friend indeed. The Chinese people never forget Dr. Kotnis, and we have been doing things for the development of Dr. Kotnis' hometown for such a long time. Last year, the Chinese Consulate General in Mumbai and some Chinese enterprises upgraded the facilities for this school. We are ready to provide more assistance to the school and the students within our capacity.
Dear teachers, students and friends.
China and India have a long history of cultural exchanges and mutual learning. Along the ancient Silk Road, Chinese paper-making, silk, porcelain, and tea were brought to India. And Indian singing, dancing, astronomy, architecture and spices were introduced in China. There are striking similarities between Chinese Taichi and India's Yoga, and between the traditional Chinese medicine and India's Ayurveda. Chinese and Indian philosophies have a lot in common too. In China, Indian friends like Dr. Kotnis and Rabindranath Tagore are well-known and Indian culture such as Bollywood films and yoga is popular. In India, we are always impressed by Indian people's interests in China and support for China-India relations.
The development of China and India reinforces each other. We are both ancient civilizations and are the two most populous countries in the world. Development is the greatest common goal of both countries. China is realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through the Chinese path to modernization. India has also put forward the vision of becoming a developed country by 2047. China wants to develop well for itself, and hopes India will develop well too. President Murmu told me that a good India-China relationship is important not only for the two countries, but also for the development and stability of the region and the world. She said that our two countries should strive to cultivate good neighbourly relations. China shares the same expectation.
Dear teachers, students and friends.
People-to-people friendship holds the key to state-to-state relations. The students here today are an important link between China and India. Only by strengthening exchanges between the young people of China and India, can the seeds of our friendship take roots and blossom. I hope that you will cherish your youth, study hard and contribute to the friendship between Chinese and Indian people.
Tagore said that the spirit of youth is a piece of jewel that turns iron into gold. Youth always goes hand in hand with dreams. Seeing is believing. You are welcome to visit and study in China. We hope that China will be the place where you can fulfil your dreams.
The Chinese poet Du Fu of the Tang Dynasty wrote in his poem that: try to ascend the mountain's crest, it dwarfs all peaks under our feet. It means that you must climb to the highest peak then you could see the lower mountains in front of you. China and India are close neighbors. If we only look through our own perspective, neither of us can get the whole picture of the Himalayas. Only if we stand high, can we look far with vision and conviction. I believe that the China-India relationship will definitely move forward along the sound and stable track. This must also be what Dr. Kotnis wished to see.
Thank you all!

China: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian's Regular Press Conference on July 8, 2024
: CCTV: President Xi Jinping has concluded his state visit to Tajikistan. Could you share with us the outcomes of the visit?
Lin Jian: At the invitation of President Emomali Rahmon of the Republic of Tajikistan, President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Tajikistan from July 4 to 6. This is his third visit to Tajikistan and the first visit by China's top leader to Tajikistan after the 20th CPC National Congress, and carries historic significance.
Tajikistan placed high importance on this visit. President Rahmon went to the airport to greet and see off President Xi. President Xi attended the welcoming ceremony held by President Rahmon. The two presidents held small-group and large-group talks, and had an in-depth exchange of views on China-Tajikistan relations, mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields and international and regional affairs of mutual interest. President Xi conferred the Friendship Medal on President Rahmon. The two presidents attended the signing ceremony, met the press together, and attended the completion ceremony of the Tajik parliament building and government building that China helped build. President Xi also attended the welcoming banquet hosted by President Rahmon and the two presidents had a good chat over tea.
The two presidents signed the joint statement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Tajikistan on developing a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership in the new era, announcing the decision to develop the China-Tajikistan comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership in the new era, and agreeing to build a China-Tajikistan community with a shared future featuring everlasting friendship, solidarity and mutual benefit at a higher level. Relevant departments of the two countries signed over 20 cooperation documents in areas such as trade, connectivity, critical mineral, security and people-to-people and cultural exchange.
The two sides agreed to focus on high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, fully synergize development strategies, accelerate the progress of major cooperation projects, such as the upgrade of the key section of the China-Tajikistan Highway Phase II project, deepen mineral cooperation, and contribute to each other's modernization. The two sides stand ready to step up people-to-people and cultural exchange and cooperation in various fields, and cement the social foundation of our everlasting friendship. The two countries will make full use of the Sino-Tajik Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Luban Workshop and other platforms, accelerate the mutual establishment of cultural centers, and support more youth exchanges, women exchanges, and exchanges in such areas as media, think tank and education. The two sides are resolved to step up security cooperation, including jointly fighting terrorist, extremist and separatist forces such as ETIM, keeping the China-Tajikistan border secure, resolutely opposing interference of any third party in the two countries' internal affairs, and keeping our region safe and stable. The two sides will continue to strengthen communication and coordination on the Afghan issue, and cooperate under relevant mechanisms. The two sides speak highly of the outcomes of China-Central Asia cooperation, and stand ready to strengthen the China-Central Asia mechanism. Having taken over the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China will host the SCO summit next year and welcomes President Rahmon to attend the summit in China. We will work with Tajikistan to carry forward the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and contribute to global peace and development together.
President Xi's visit had a rich program and produced fruitful results. It marked yet another milestone in the history of China-Tajikistan relations. We have full confidence in the prospects of our bilateral relations. China will remain firmly committed to our mutually beneficial cooperation with Tajikistan. No matter how the international landscape may evolve, China will always be Tajikistan's trustworthy friend, reliable partner, and close brother.
AFP: Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary is in China today for talks on the war in Ukraine. Is Mr. Orbán here on behalf of the EU or just Hungary?
Lin Jian: On the morning of July 8, President Xi Jinping met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing. China has released a readout which you may refer to.
During the meeting, President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Viktor Orbán exchanged views on bilateral relations, China-EU relations and issues of mutual interest. The discussion focused on in-depth communication on the Ukraine crisis. Prime Minister Orbán shared information about his recent visit to Ukraine and Russia. President Xi commended the Prime Minister for his effort to seek a political solution and shared China's perspective and proposition on the issue. President Xi stressed that an early ceasefire and political settlement of the crisis is in the interest of all parties. The priority now is to observe the three principles of no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party, and to work for deescalation as quickly as possible. The international community should provide conditions and support for the resumption of direct dialogue and negotiation between the two parties. Only when all major countries play a positive rather than negative role, can this conflict see an early prospect of ceasefire. China has been actively promoting peace talks in its own way, and encourages and supports all efforts conducive to a peaceful settlement. China and Hungary share the same basic propositions and are working in the same direction. China is prepared to stay in communication with Hungary and the relevant parties.
Xinhua News Agency: China announced Guinea-Bissau President's visit to China. Could you share with us the program and China's expectation for the visit? How does China view its current relations with Guinea-Bissau?
Lin Jian: China's friendship with Guinea-Bissau was cultivated by the older generation of leaders of both countries. In the 1970s, the Chinese people firmly supported the people in Guinea-Bissau in pursuing national independence and liberation. In recent years, the two sides have firmly supported each other on issues concerning each other's core interests, engaged in highly productive cooperation in the fields of economic and social development, and maintained communication and coordination on international affairs. Our friendly ties have been going from strength to strength.
During the visit, President Xi Jinping will hold a welcoming ceremony and banquet for President Embaló. The two presidents will hold talks. Premier Li Qiang will meet with President Embaló. We believe this visit will be a strong boost for deepening our bilateral ties and solidifying our friendly cooperation.
Reuters: The Philippines and Japan have signed a reciprocal access agreement. It's a defence pact that allows both nations to deploy forces on each other's soil. What is China's view of this development?
Lin Jian: The exchange and cooperation between countries should not undermine the mutual understanding and trust between other countries in the region. It should not threaten regional peace and stability, target any third party, or harm the interests of any third party. The Asia-Pacific region does not need any military bloc, still less groupings that incite bloc confrontation or a new Cold War. Any move that undermines regional peace and stability, and harms regional solidarity and cooperation will be met with vigilance and opposition from people in regional countries. Japan bears serious historical responsibilities for its aggression and colonial rule over the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries during WWII. Japan needs to reflect on that part of history and act prudently in fields related to military and security.
Global Times: We noted China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center, National Engineering Laboratory for Computer Virus Prevention Technology and the 360 Digital Security Group jointly released a report. It revealed that the US since 2023 has been creating hypes about the group named Volt Typhoon and engaged in a worldwide disinformation campaign against China. What's China's comment?
Lin Jian: I noted the report you mentioned. Actually, back in April, relevant Chinese agencies revealed the scandal about the US framing China for being responsible for Volt Typhoon in order to advance the US's geopolitical agenda. The latest report further revealed that this disinformation campaign is conceived by NSA, FBI and other members of the US intelligence community with the participation of congressional China hawks and multiple federal agencies as well as cybersecurity agencies from other Five Eye countries, and aimed to manipulate public opinion.
Till this day, the US still owes us an explanation after the previous report was released, and the US NSA chief continues to spread disinformation about Volt Typhoon. What is worse, the latest report exposed that the US government has been pressuring a cybersecurity company and asking it to rewrite its tech analysis that proves Volt Typhoon to be a ransomware group. This is a clumsy cover-up tactic and clearly has not and will not work.
China strongly condemns the irresponsible behavior of the US. The US still owes us an explanation, and should stop its smears and vilification against China at once. We urge the US to act responsibly and contribute to the peace and security of the cyberspace.
Bloomberg: I just want to follow up on the Reuters' question earlier on the Japan-Philippines forces agreement. Does the Chinese government see this as being aimed at China? You said that Asia-Pacific doesn't need military groupings that are aimed at any one party. Is this your view that this agreement is aimed at China?
Lin Jian: I made it quite clear just now that any exchange, cooperation or signing of agreement or treaty between two countries should not undermine the mutual understanding and trust between other countries in the region, or target and harm the interests of any third party, still less should it threaten regional peace and stability.
Bloomberg: The Chinese PLA is deployed to Belarus for an exercise in the last few days. Do you see any equivalence between the Chinese PLA deploying to that country and the agreement that is happening between Japan and the Philippines today in that Japan and the Philippines don't see this or they haven't stated this agreement is being aimed at anyone. But many countries in Europe have expressed alarm that the PLA is being deployed or is on an exercise in Belarus.
Lin Jian: On the joint exercise between China and Belarus, I'd refer you to competent authorities. Let me point out that I do not see any basis for the comparison that you mentioned.
Beijing Youth Daily: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a press statement extended best wishes to Dalai Lama on the occasion of his 89th birthday, and reaffirmed US commitment to supporting efforts to preserve Tibetans' distinct linguistic, cultural, and religious heritage, including the ability to freely choose religious leaders. What is China's comment?
Lin Jian: The position of the Chinese government on Xizang-related issues is consistent and clear. Xizang affairs are China's internal affairs which brook no interference by any external forces. Over the years, Xizang has enjoyed a booming economy, social harmony and stability, and sound preservation of its cultural heritage. The rights and freedoms of all ethnic groups in Xizang, including the freedom of religious belief and the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages, are fully protected. This is a fact and seen by many in the international community.
As many people know, the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion. We urge the US to fully understand the gravity and sensitivity of Xizang-related issues, truly respect China's core interests, be fully aware of the Dalai group's anti-China and separatist nature, honor the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang, and stop supporting or endorsing in any way the Xizang independence forces and their anti-China and separatist activities.
Bloomberg: Japan's Nikkei newspaper today reported that at the NATO summit in Washington DC, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand will sign an agreement with NATO to increase their cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Does China have a response to this report?
Lin Jian: As a Cold War legacy and the world's biggest military alliance, NATO claims itself to be a regional defensive alliance on the one hand, but on the other hand keeps breaching its boundary, expanding its mandate, reaching beyond its defense zone, and stoking confrontation, which reveals its deeply embedded Cold War mentality and ideological bias. This is the real source of risks threatening global peace and stability. NATO should stay within its role as a regional defensive alliance, stop creating tensions in the Asia-Pacific, stop peddling Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation. NATO should not try to destabilize the Asia-Pacific after it has done so to Europe.
Reuters: The Philippine Coast Guard said on Saturday that China's largest coast guard vessel has anchored in Manila's exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea, and they also said this is meant to intimidate the Philippines. This follows the high-level dialogue between both countries last week that was aimed at restoring trust. Could the Ministry share more information about this vessel and how was it happening so soon after those talks?
Lin Jian: Xianbin Jiao is part of China's Nansha Qundao, not the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. To patrol and conduct law enforcement activities by Chinese military and Coast Guard vessels in the waters near Xianbin Jiao is within China's domestic law and international law, including UNCLOS.

China: Staying True to Our Shared Commitment and Opening a New Chapter in China-Kazakhstan Relations
: All beings are flourishing in the height of summer. I will soon pay a state visit to Kazakhstan and attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in this vibrant season at the invitation of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. This will be my fifth visit to your country as the President of the People's Republic of China. Kazakhstan's enchanting land, its splendid and distinctive culture, its vast and magnificent landscape, and its nice and friendly people have been most impressive. The visit offers me an opportunity to experience first hand the new progress and new changes that have been made in Kazakhstan. I look forward to meeting with President Tokayev to plan the way forward for closer China-Kazakhstan cooperation and draw a new blueprint for further growth of China-Kazakhstan relations and the SCO.
Over 2,000 years ago, Zhang Qian, a royal emissary from China led a diplomatic mission to the Western Regions, opening the door to friendship and exchanges between China and Central Asia. The ancient Silk Road, of which Zhang was a pioneer, contributed to the friendly exchanges and mutual learning between our two great nations. Over 80 years ago, Chinese musician Xian Xinghai and Kazahk composer Bakhtzhan Baikadamov met and came to know each other in Almaty. They soon became bosom friends and devoted brothers despite their different nationalities. Thirty-two years ago, China was among the first countries to recognize Kazakhstan's independence. China-Kazakhstan relations have since embarked on a new journey. The history of China-Kazakhstan friendly exchanges is a strong testament to the fact that the development of our bilateral relationship conforms to the trend of history and that of our times.
It was in Kazakhstan eleven years ago that I first proposed the initiative of the Silk Road Economic Belt, which was warmly received by people from different sectors in Kazakhstan. This marked a magnificent chapter in Belt and Road cooperation between our two countries. And the development of China-Kazakhstan relations have since entered a new stage.
Our two countries have always supported each other and have always been partners in times of challenge. Our mutual political trust has reached a new level. The China-Kazakhstan relationship has made a leap from a comprehensive strategic partnership to a permanent comprehensive strategic partnership. The two countries have agreed on the vision of building a China-Kazakhstan community with a shared future defined by lasting friendship, a high degree of mutual trust and sharing weal and woe. We have rendered each other firm support on issues that bear on our respective core interests and are of major concern to us. We respect the development path that each has chosen according to our respective national conditions. We have always been trustworthy and reliable partners and would invariably extend a helping hand and do our utmost to support each other when we were hit by disasters like floods and pandemics. Such unbreakable mutual trust and support are invaluable, forming the strongest political cornerstone that underpins our bilateral cooperation.
Our two countries have always pursued mutual benefit, win-win and coordinated development, achieving new success in results-oriented cooperation. Last year, our two-way trade registered a record high of US$41 billion. China is now Kazakhstan's largest trading partner and its top export destination. Major strategic projects including the Zhanatas wind farm, Turgusun hydropower station, and the modernization of Shymkent Oil Refinery have been completed and commissioned. China-Kazakhstan crude oil and natural gas pipelines are operating in a safe and stable manner. The green lanes for fast customs clearance of agricultural products are available at all border ports between the two countries, which makes green agri-products of high quality from Kazakhstan easily accessible for Chinese consumers. The potential for cooperation in new energy and transportation infrastructure has been unleashed. The transport and logistics terminal in Xi'an, the Western Europe-Western China Highway, and the China-Europe Railway Express all operate smoothly, providing a strong boost to the development of both China and Kazakhstan.
Our two countries have always helped and learned from each other and witnessed a new upsurge in people-to-people and cultural exchanges. A China-Kazakhstan agreement on mutual establishment of cultural centers has been signed. Chinese and Kazakh filmmakers have co-produced a film entitled The Composer, which is their first co-production. Our bilateral programs for cultural cooperation, including a Chinese university campus in Kazakhstan, a Luban Workshop, and a center of traditional Chinese medicine, have been fully implemented. These institutions are now up and running. Thanks to our mutual visa-exemption arrangements, our people can visit each other as frequently as relatives do. Last year, a total of 600,000 cross-border trips were recorded. In the first quarter of this year, the number of visits in both directions amounted to 200,000 and are expected to reach a new high. Subnational cooperation is also booming, with the number of sister cities increasing to 26 pairs. The much respected and lauded ophthalmologist Dr. Saulebek Kabibekov, the panda-man Ruslan Tulenov, who voluntarily donated his rare type of blood in China, and the immensely popular singer Dimash Kudaibergen have become China-Kazakhstan friendship envoys in the new era.
Our two countries have always worked together in response to various challenges, and our coordination and collaboration at the international level has achieved new and tangible results. China and Kazakhstan hold similar positions on international and regional affairs. Both countries champion the vision of common, comprehensive cooperative and sustainable security. And both are committed to acting as a world peace builder, a global development contributor, and an international order defender. We have jointly created a China-Central Asia cooperation mechanism, and maintained close coordination and collaboration in the United Nations, the SCO, and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia, among other multilateral organizations. We have actively supported each other's constructive proposals for international cooperation, and taken resolute measures to safeguard our shared strategic, security, and development interests.
China and Kazakhstan can and will accomplish a great deal in bilateral cooperation in the years to come. I hope my visit will help renew our traditional friendship and deepen the all-round cooperation between our countries. During my visit, President Tokayev and I will meet and plan the way forward for further growth of China-Kazakhstan relations and discuss how best to take the China-Kazakhstan permanent comprehensive strategic partnership to new heights.
First, our two countries need to further consolidate our political tradition of mutual support. As a Chinese saying goes, We must be people of our word in dealing with friends. China will continue to treat our Kazakh friends with sincerity and engage them with trust. China will work with Kazakhstan to further consolidate mutual political trust, strengthen strategic communication, and firmly support each other on issues that bear on our respective core interests and are of major concern to us. As always, China will support Kazakhstan in upholding its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, in continuing on the development path suited to its national conditions, in implementing domestic and foreign policies in the interest of its development and prosperity, and in opposing interference in its internal affairs by any external forces. Our two countries need to always follow the four principles that hold key to the success of our cooperation, namely, mutual respect, good neighborly friendship, solidarity in trying times, and mutual benefit, so as to ensure sustained and steady growth of China-Kazakhstan relations.
Second, our two countries need to stay committed to the golden rule of mutual benefit and win-win in our cooperation. China and Kazakhstan have different yet complementary resource endowments and industries. This offers huge potential for cooperation. China stands ready to promote greater synergy between Belt and Road cooperation and the economic policies under a Just Kazakhstan at a faster pace, and further open our super-sized market to Kazakhstan so that our Kazakh friends can share the opportunities of our development. Our two countries need to deepen cooperation in traditional sectors including business, trade, industrial capacity, investment, energy, mining and agriculture, and enhance the efficiency of customs clearance at border ports. We need to ensure the high-quality operation of the China-Europe Railway Express, advance the construction of the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, and make the network connecting our two countries more multidimensional, diverse and efficient. We need to significantly unleash the potential for cooperation in such high-tech areas as new energy, the digital economy, artificial intelligence, cross-border e-commerce, aviation and aerospace, and build more industrial and supply chains with high added-values, in order to inject new impetus to our cooperation.
Third, our two countries need to strengthen public support for an everlasting China-Kazakhstan friendship. A deeper and stronger China-Kazakhstan friendship is what our two peoples aspire to. It is therefore important that we carry forward such friendship and enhance mutual understanding and affinity between our peoples through a diverse range of cultural and people-to-people exchange programs. Our two countries need to ensure the success of the Luban Workshop, Confucius Institutes, and the Kazakh campus of the Northwestern Polytechnical University to foster future generations who will carry forward the China-Kazakhstan friendship. China welcomes joint education programs and joint research projects between Chinese and Kazakh higher education institutions, think tanks and research institutes. China supports closer interactions between people from all sectors across Chinese and Kazakh societies. Both countries need to encourage more twinning between our provinces and cities and more cooperation on education, tourism, archaeology, arts, and media, so as to expand the depth and scope of China-Kazakhstan cultural and people-to-people exchanges.
Fourth, our two countries need to be responsive to the accelerated changes on a scale unseen in a century that are unfolding across the world. Changes and turbulence in the global landscape pose new threats and new challenges, but also bring new opportunities and create new possibilities for all-round cooperation of mutual benefit between China and Kazakhstan. We Chinese believe that in every challenge lies an opportunity, and that challenges and opportunities are interchangeable. China stands ready to join hands with Kazakhstan in response to the changes of historic significance that are taking place in our world and in our times. We need to foster new opportunities amid crises, and open up new horizons on a shifting landscape. China will work with Kazakhstan to uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, act on true multilateralism, oppose hegemonism, power politics and bloc confrontation. We will work together to build an equal and orderly multipolar world, promote universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and bring about more positivity and certainty to world peace and stability.
Another important item on my agenda in Kazakhstan is to attend the SCO Summit. China highly commends the successful and fruitful work Kazakhstan has done in its capacity as the SCO chair to grow the influence of the organization. I have no doubt that the SCO Astana Summit will be a great success through concerted efforts of all parties and will help rally the SCO family closer and open up new prospects for SCO cooperation.
As a Chinese saying goes, Success comes to those who share in one purpose. Triumph belongs to those who pull together in times of challenge. In Kazakhstan, people say that five fingers held together make a powerful fist, and many people working in unity form a mighty force.
China will work shoulder to shoulder with Kazakhstan on the path to national prosperity and rejuvenation. Let us jointly draw up a new blueprint for closer cooperation and open a new chapter in China-Kazakhstan friendly relations.

Study: Avoiding water after meals for digestive health
: ALBAWABA Avoiding drinking water immediately after meals is a practice advocated by some dietary experts and traditional health systems. The rationale behind this advice stems from various theories regarding digestion and its impact on overall health.
One common belief is that consuming water immediately after meals dilutes the digestive juices in the stomach, potentially hindering the breakdown of food. According to this perspective, optimal digestion requires a certain concentration of stomach acid and enzymes, which can be disrupted by excess water intake.
Additionally, some proponents suggest that drinking water right after meals may lead to bloating or discomfort due to the combination of food and liquid in the stomach. This can result in a feeling of fullness or heaviness, which may be uncomfortable for some individuals.
Moreover, certain traditional health practices, such as Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, caution against drinking cold water with meals. In these systems, cold beverages are believed to extinguish the digestive fire, slowing down the digestive process and potentially leading to issues like indigestion or sluggish metabolism.
However, it's essential to note that scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited. While some people may indeed experience discomfort or digestive disturbances after consuming water with meals, others may not notice any adverse effects.
Ultimately, whether or not to drink water immediately after meals may depend on individual preferences and digestive sensitivity. Some individuals may find it helpful to wait a short while after eating before drinking water, while others may not experience any issues with simultaneous consumption.
As with many dietary recommendations, it's essential to listen to your body and pay attention to how different practices affect your digestion and overall well-being. Consulting with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian can also provide personalized guidance based on individual health needs and goals.

How China's Retirement Crisis Is Contributing to Weak Consumption
: Brown, Tanner. 
: Li Zhong attended the recent Shanghai RV Show 2024, even though he knew his dreams of buying one and crisscrossing the country with his wife had been put on hold.
The pause is hitting many older people like himself around China, as they find themselves in worse financial shape upon retirement than expected.
"We're waiting a few years now, to see if things, financial things, strengthen up," said the 58-year-old. Li will retire at 60 from his job at a private Chinese traditional medicine company, where he works in sales.
China's pension system has gradually devolved from a robust state-supported payment plan to a three-tiered system: a state-endorsed public pension, enterprise annuities, and personal pensions.
The latter two are voluntary, and they have remained in the shadow of the state system. But that nationwide system is beginning to hit a perfect storm as a demographic crisis and economic malaise tear into funding.
The scope of the problem is breathtaking. By 2035, roughly 300 million people, currently aged 50 to 60, will have left the Chinese workforce, according to government statistics. The normal retirement and pension age is 60 for men, 50 for blue collar women and 55 for white collar women—among the lowest retirement ages in the world.
This swelling of the retirement cohort will overwhelm the number of working-age Chinese, who are already struggling with unemployment, burnout, and disillusionment .
China encouraged huge families in the 1960s and 1970s under leader Mao Zedong but then instituted a strict one-child policy three years after his death in 1976. That has created what is now a sharp drop-off in the young versus old ratio. The population is shrinking and becoming much older.
Within the next generation—roughly 25 years—more than 500 million people, or nearly 40% of the population, will be older than 60. China's pre-eminent think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), has calculated that the public pension system will run dry within the next decade.
"In the era of aging, economic growth will encounter new challenges. On the one hand, the driving force of exports and investment in the economy will gradually be replaced by consumption; on the other hand, aging itself will bring some factors that are not conducive to consumption," said Cai Fang, the vice president of CASS and China's most prominent scholar tasked to tackle the problem.
But older consumers are only becoming more reluctant to spend, Li of the RV show said, because the financial floor beneath their feet is shaky. According to a survey by Chinese recruitment website 51job.com in 2022, more than two-thirds of Chinese senior citizens plan to return to the workplace after retirement.
Other factors have added to the problem. China's property bubble has deflated, draining billions of savings from families across the country , where 70% of family assets are tied up in real estate.
A secondary place older Chinese had begun putting their investments is now playing a part in frigid consumer sentiment, as well.
"A 2019 People's Bank of China survey found that households headed up by someone over 65 years old had a larger share of their financial assets in wealth management products. Many of these products posted losses at the end of 2022 and early 2023, and returns have fallen sharply for WMPs as bond yields have come down," Adam Wolfe, emerging markets economist at Absolute Strategy Research, told Barron's.
Wolfe said that too many retirees had too much of their savings concentrated in risky assets like wealth management products as they believed these assets had an implicit guarantee. After absorbing losses from those investments last year, many appear to have shifted more of their savings into low-yielding money-market and bond funds, he said. So one reason for working more might be that they're receiving less income than they expected from their investments.
The hesitancy to spend isn't confined to retirees. The array of sibling-less children who are now expected to support their aging parents are having to reallocate funds that could be spent on consumer goods but instead will now go toward parental support.
The government's reluctance to stimulate consumption by transferring funds to citizens, as much of the West did during the pandemic, has soured economists' views of China's near-term prospects.
"Strengthening the pension system would definitely boost consumption in the long term, but it wouldn't have much impact in the short term. That's because a stronger pension system would need to be tested over many years before it was credible enough to change actual spending behavior," Michael Pettis, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, told Barron's from Beijing.
"But if China were to make greater pension payments to current retirees, that would cause consumption today to rise."
Wang Tao, chief China economist and head of Asia economics at UBS Investment Research, concurred, telling Barron's that the government needs to open its pocketbook to the people to stimulate spending.
"These measures can help boost people's confidence about the future, lower their saving rate, and hence, boost consumption," he said.

Temple of Bloom: travel
: Need to realign your chakras and still that monkey mind? We road test celebrity magnet Ananda Spa in the Himalayas.
It’s not the best start. “You are vata predominant, but your pitta is running high – a little out of control, in fact,” says Dr Harilal, a tall, lean practitioner of Ayurvedic science, India’s ancient holistic healing system. He hands me a seven-page document titled The basic principles of Ayurvedic medicine, which begins: “All human beings have all three doshas (life forces or energies) in their constitution, but in unique proportions where one dosha is usually stronger and predominant than the others.” The three types are vata (space and air), pitta (fi re and water), and kapha (water and earth). As a vata, my skin and hair are most likely on the dry side, my digestive system is fl exible but also inconsistent. I’m a light sleeper prone to insomnia – and while I am energetic, I tire easily and lack stamina. I’m quick and “agile of mind”, but also an indecisive worrier, and anxious. Vatas are prone to injury, arthritis, aches and pains, and infrequent bowel movements. My overactive pitta suggests I’m even more “biting and sarcastic” than usual, obsessed with work projects, and will feel extreme discomfort in hot weather. I’m really not liking my Ayurvedic self. “Let’s get to work then,” Dr Harilal says, reaching for a blood detox potion called “Nimbamritasavam”, made by Kottakkal Ayurveda since 1902. Two drops daily will help my sinusitis, which will in turn ease lethargy and headaches. Given a 500ml bottle costs 100 rupees (less than $2), I’m all ears now, leaning forward to grab the elixir from his desk as he checks the length of my stay. “Oh dear,” he qualifi es – “OK, so we can fi x some of your issues, but you’re only here three nights. That’s not long enough to address everything.” Now we both look anxious. We’re sitting in his small consulting room, looking out at the wild forest of native sal trees – set beyond the clipped lawns of Ananda in the Himalayas, a luxury wellness retreat that’s energetically patrolled by beadyeyed peacocks and synchronised fl ocks of bright-green parrots with long yellow tails. The centrepiece of this 40-hectare resort-style estate is an old palace built by the maharaja of Tehri Garhwal. A grand apartment with terrace was added to the building in 1911. Now named the Viceregal Suite, it was used by travelling British royals, aristocrats and other dignitaries over the decades. More latterly, well-heeled wellness pilgrims who fancy staying in the room once used by Louis Mountbatten can bed down here. Drive through Ananda’s grand cast-iron gates, past the palace (which today houses the resort’s reception, plus a sitting room and library for guests), head down the steep driveway, and you arrive at the newer complex that comprises Ananda proper: a large block of spacious suites and rooms for up to 140 guests. There are also three private villas (with one and two bedrooms), each with its own garden and plunge pool. The 2230-square-metre spa, with its menu of 80 body and beauty treatments, forms Ananda’s beating heart where much of the action takes place. It all screams of the fact that wellness is increasingly big business in India. The country ranked seventh in the global wellness economy monitor in 2022, with a market size of $US132.5 billion ($203.6 billion), according to the Global Wellness Institute. Of the many luxury spa options across India, it’s hard to imagine a better choice than Ananda, nestled up in the clouds, among the lower reaches of the Himalayas, overlooking the Ganges Valley and bustling Rishikesh – once on the hippie trail as the birthplace of yoga. Since it was created in 2001 by Delhi businessman Ashok Khanna (a devotee of Ayurveda, yoga and Vedanta – and a veteran of the Oberoi Group of hotels), Ananda has scored accolades everywhere from The Telegraph in London to The New York Times. It has been awarded the world’s No. 1 destination spa six times by readers of Condé Nast Traveller. The alumni guest list reads like an Oscars roll call and includes Uma Thurman, Nicole Kidman, Kate Winslet, Liz Hurley, Oprah Winfrey and Ricky Martin. King Charles and Camilla stayed here in 2013. “We hope we are voted the best for the service and the staff,” says Soumya Banerjee, the director of rooms, as he shows me around. Looking at the panorama, he adds, “also nothing can beat the Ganges and the Himalayas for a view”. The Delhi-based friend who got me in here, Jamshyd Sethna, later explains: “No one can spin vedic stuff like us. But I fi nd Ananda is less pushy and far more genteel. I would personally focus on the treatments, yoga and such, and ignore the rest. I keep returning to Ananda as I like the very relaxed vibe, plus the treatments are excellent.”
Sethna, the founder-owner of Shakti Himalaya and Banyan Tours, often sends guests there for a few days of R&R or an extended stay after they have hiked the higher ranges of the Himalayas, in which many of his boutique Shakti properties are located. Suffi ce to say, Ananda’s setting is a showstopper. The air is sweet, the hills are alive with the sound of expensive water features, and each dawn brings the promise of yet more dewy facials and vigorous Himalayan salt scrubs – in between your wheat shots, buttermilk, and protein pancakes with curd. A better, cleaner, more mindful and less materialistic you is a polished stone’s throw away. At around $US11,000 ($16,950) for a fi ve-day all-inclusive package in an entrylevel garden-view room, you’d hope so. Then again, don’t get too disinterested in money or you’ll never be able to afford it. With the price point top of mind, I’m counting my lucky chakras to be here at all, even if it is a threenight fl ash-in-the-pan media stay. Real guests usually book in for seven to 21 days. Some even stay two months, at which point, you’re pretty much booted out to go work on your inner child at home. (Always with the warm invitation to return, of course.) After check-in, my 45-minute consultation with Dr Harilal and a quick look around, I settle into room 510, with views of the hills and the river. I sit cross-legged on the bed like the newly minted wellness convert I am, perusing Dr Harilal’s recommended diet and other notes, along with my treatment schedule, and the daily activities everyone is encouraged to join in.
I have two full days here, and the fi rst one looks like this: a 7.15am morning mantra chant, followed by an hour of hatha yoga, then breakfast at 8.30. At 11am it’s time for a 90-minute grounding aromatherapy massage before an emotional healing consultation at 2. Choose from a nature walk or afternoon tea at 4, then there’s a Vedanta talk at 6.15 and dinner at 7. At least one spa treatment a day is included in the package, but I have been turbocharged on Sethna’s orders. “You don’t go somewhere like Ananda to see the sights,” Sethna chastises by text on learning of my request for time out to see Rishikesh. “That’s a not great, very touristy town. You’re at Ananda to be pampered. Do two treatments a day. More if you can.” I’m not sorry when I depart with six treatments under my belt, including refl exology, and the two-therapist, four-hands Abhyanga massage with dosha-specifi c warm herb-infused oil. There are also physiotherapists, fi tness experts, doctors of Chinese traditional medicine and meditation experts on site. It’s the full monty on the road to glowing good health. For sustenance, a central dining room with a vast shady outdoor terrace keeps guests well fed and hydrated. The food is calorie-conscious, nutritious and fresh, with dishes such as Japanese pumpkin salad with boiled eggs, and slow-roasted carrots, chickpeas and courgettes tossed with feta, quinoa and mustard honey dressing. To rebalance our doshas and clinically detox (if you are a 21-day guest), some are on personalised meal plans, while others (like me) are simply trying to avoid certain foods – such as acidic fruits, sourdough and dairy. Rest assured plenty of cheating goes on for those in the “just try to avoid” category. Alcohol is defi nitely out, and caffeinated coffee is frowned upon in the dining room – but it’s readily available in your room. Carb-heavy foods such as pasta and rice are not served at dinner, nor is red meat. All that’s left to add is I never once felt hungry. Nor did I miss my usual double espressos. The calming CFC tea (cumin, fennel and coriander seeds) was a refreshing alternative. But the real fun came with the group activities. After all, exactly who, other than movie stars and celebrities, do these places attract? It’s hard to get a handle on this at fi rst blush given all guests mostly wear the provided uniform of loose-fi tting soft cotton kurta tunic and long pants – known as the Ananda “whites”. But the slip-ons lying outside the yoga pavilion each morning confi rm the guests aren’t always so spartan: pearl-encrusted Chanel fl ip-fl ops, along with Donna Karan, Tory Burch and Burberry footwear. The only ends they are struggling to make meet are during the forward-bending, eight-angle Yoganidrasana pose.
hands. And men in branded sports caps, iPhones fi rmly on silent, even if you can tell it’s killing them. “There’s a nice friendly vibe, but a lot of people come here for introspection,” says Banerjee. “If you get talking and socialising too much, it can take the focus off you.” Fair point. I resolve to talk less and group chant more. On my second-last day, during the three-hour morning hike to Kunjapuri Temple, I meet French Sophie from Paris and Greek Roula who used to live in Paris, and now resides in London. The pair have been fi rm friends for decades. “We love to catch up like this,” explains Roula with a wave of her hand. “I’ve tried a few of these places, and this one is particularly good.” We walk and chat, laughing and high-fi ving the school children skipping along the winding village path, their scruffy dogs in tow; smiling at the farmers milking their cows. It’s a perfect morning and I nod enthusiastically at Sophie and Roula’s musings, thinking I could defi nitely get used to 7am temple walks with girl pals like these, followed by peanut butter protein pancakes. In fact, I realise, I feel fantastic. That Dr Harilal is a magician; maybe there’s something in the 100-rupee Nimbamritasavam potion after all.

Incredible effects of just one teaspoon of turmeric on your body and skin daily
: ALBAWABA Turmeric, the golden spice often found in kitchens worldwide, has gained a reputation not just for its vibrant color and earthy flavor, but also for its remarkable health benefits.
For centuries, this humble herb has been celebrated in traditional medicine practices, particularly in Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine, for its potent healing properties. In recent years, scientific research has delved deeper into the potential health effects of turmeric, unveiling a plethora of benefits associated with its consumption.
One of the most fascinating discoveries is the incredible impact just one teaspoon of turmeric can have on the human body when incorporated into daily consumption.
The Power of Curcumin At the heart of turmeric's health benefits lies curcumin, a bioactive compound responsible for its vibrant hue and many of its medicinal properties.
Curcumin boasts powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and even anticancer properties, making it a versatile tool in promoting overall health and well-being.
1. Anti-Inflammatory Properties
Chronic inflammation is increasingly recognized as a root cause of various health problems, including heart disease, cancer, and autoimmune disorders.
2. Antioxidant Activity
Antioxidants play a crucial role in neutralizing harmful free radicals in the body, which can cause oxidative stress and damage to cells.
3. Heart Health Benefits
Maintaining cardiovascular health is essential for overall well-being, and turmeric may offer significant support in this regard.
4. Digestive Support
Turmeric has a long history of use in traditional medicine for digestive issues, and modern research confirms its efficacy in promoting gastrointestinal health.
Turmeric for skin: Is it beneficial? Turmeric has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its various health benefits, including for the skin. Here are some ways in which turmeric may benefit the skin:
1. Anti-inflammatory properties: Turmeric contains compounds like curcumin that have anti-inflammatory properties. This can help in reducing redness, swelling, and irritation on the skin, making it beneficial for conditions like acne, eczema, and psoriasis.
2. Antioxidant effects: Turmeric is rich in antioxidants, which help protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals. This can slow down the aging process and prevent wrinkles and fine lines.
3. Treatment of acne: Due to its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, turmeric can help in treating acne. It can reduce the inflammation associated with acne and inhibit the growth of acne-causing bacteria.
4. Brightening complexion: Turmeric is often used to brighten the skin and even out skin tone. It can reduce the appearance of dark spots and hyperpigmentation, giving the skin a more radiant appearance.
5. Scar reduction: Some research suggests that turmeric may help in reducing the appearance of scars by promoting collagen production and speeding up the healing process.
While turmeric can be beneficial for the skin, it's essential to use it properly to avoid any adverse reactions. Some people may be allergic to turmeric, so it's a good idea to do a patch test before using it on the face.
Incorporating Turmeric Into Your Daily Routine
Harnessing the incredible effects of turmeric is as simple as adding just one teaspoon of this potent spice to your daily routine.
Whether sprinkled onto your morning smoothie, stirred into soups and stews, or blended into a comforting cup of golden milk, there are numerous creative ways to incorporate turmeric into your diet and reap its myriad health benefits.

Recharge Mind, Body, and Soul: Four Seasons Invites Guests to Discover Wellness Their Own Way
: Wellness may be one of today’s hottest topics, and it’s certainly a priority for travellers seeking time and space to rest, relax and recharge. But what does a wellness retreat look like for today’s traveller?
For many, a vacation is the ultimate opportunity to focus on oneself and reconnect. A week-long retreat dedicated to personal growth, an invigorating new fitness program, a chance to explore local cultures and try new wellness practices guided by leading experts – or even a single day of detox or a good night’s sleep - can provide a much-needed fresh start, no matter the time of year.
At Four Seasons, wellness is a priority, encompassing nutrition, sleep, mindfulness and deeper emotional connections. From plant-based menus and in-room sleep enhancements to visiting wellness practitioners and hands-on connections to the natural world, guests can choose from diverse programming and ongoing experiences to focus on self-care, personal growth and well-being.
Here, the leading luxury hospitality brand offers a collection of what’s new and available for today’s wellness travellers at Four Seasons around the world:
Harnessing the Power of Nature
• The Iliahi Farm and Spa Experience introduces guests of Four Seasons Resort Hualalai to the natural healing properties of native plants and flowers used in Hawaiian medicine. A visit to a local iliahi (or sandalwood) farm immerses guests in environmentally and culturally responsible reforestation of the island, followed by the Iliahi Forest Essence treatment back at the Resort’s Spa, which includes a customized meditative sound journey and a scrub, cocoon and massage to maximize the healing benefits of the plant.
• Right off the beach at the new Four Seasons Resort Cabo San Lucas at Cabo Del Sol (opening May 2024), guests can learn to free dive and experience the underwater world in a personal and respectful way. The on-site Adventure Team helps guests learn the skills and gain confidence through relaxation techniques and body self-awareness.
• Taking advantage of the vast wilderness that surrounds them, Four Seasons resorts in the mountains of British Columbia and the desert of Arizona take guests on guided hikes designed to connect with nature and engage the senses. At Four Seasons Resort and Residences Whistler, Forest Bathing – based on the Japanese practice of spending time in nature for therapeutic relaxation - winds through tranquil leafy paths, weaving in mindful meditation practices along the way. At Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North, Desert Bathing is a popular light hike in the sun.
• Getting to know our fellow inhabitants on Earth can be both grounding and enlightening. At Four Seasons Resort Seychelles at Desroches Island, guests have close encounters with free-roaming giant Aldabra tortoises, and can even adopt a juvenile at the Tortoise Sanctuary, supporting the work of the island’s conservation society.
• Set on the shores of one of the world’s most renowned diving spots, Four Seasons Resort Sharm El Sheikh introduces guests to an underwater world rich in colours and teeming with marine life, including turtles, lionfish, rays and eels, plus reef systems, coral gardens and even a few intriguing shipwrecks. The on-site dive centre assists divers at all levels of experience as they explore the warm waters of the house reef, or head further out to one of the area’s 76 recognized dive sites by boat.
• On Hawaii’s smallest inhabited island, the vast darkness of the night sky sets the stage for private, guided meditation and mindfulness at Four Seasons Resort Lanai. The sparkling stars, cool Pacific breezes and fresh scents of tropical plants induce a sense of calm, and nourishing energy flows from head to toe while listening to the breaking waves of Hulopoe Bay.
• Can’t get out of the city? Head to one of Florence’s largest private gardens at Four Seasons Hotel Firenze, where the spa is located amid a four hectare (ten acre) urban oasis. Here in the Healing Garden, monthly fitness classes are led by local experts in yoga, HIIT, karate, Pilates and more.

• Six-time IRONMAN champion Dave Scott will once again host two triathlon training camps at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai this year, in June and December. Participants benefit from Dave’s experience and expertise as they swim, cycle and run the very waters and roads where the annual IRONMAN World Championship takes place along Hawaii’s Kona coast.
• At the Heart of the Earth Spa at Four Seasons Resort The Nam Hai in Vietnam, wellness programming is inspired by the teachings of renowned zen master Thich Nhat Hanh, including the daily “Goodnight Kiss to the Earth” ritual in which guests are invited to end the day to the sounds of singing bowls as they express gratitude.

Age-Old Wisdom for a Modern World

At Bar Spectre, a drink may be stronger than you think -- and you can be, too
: sphcomsg, yxmiap. 
: THE journey to Bar Spectre is tricky -- find a stairwell in an alleyway behind shophouses, or locate a tiny lift lobby off Tanjong Pagar Road and head to the second floor -- but what awaits is a shot of cocktail-based therapy.
At this mental-wellness-focused bar, tipplers are greeted not by the menu, but by a cleansing ritual with fire. They are encouraged to write down something they would like to get off their chests, set it aflame and -- thanks to the nature of magician's flash paper -- watch it vanish in the air.
"We are 'restarting' them," said founder Andrew Pang "It's like a physical reset so that they arrive mentally together."
Bar Spectre's decor evokes kintsugi -- the Japanese art of fixing broken porcelain with gold -- in its floor print, while medicine cabinets behind the bar embody its menu's vintage apothecary theme. There are 12 cocktails, grouped by flavour profile: herbal, umami, citrus and spices.
These four aromas are presented in a tiny traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) cabinet, delivered to each table. Customers can open its drawers to get a whiff of an ingredient representing each group, such as burnt peanuts for umami.
The herbal section includes Bonseki, named for the Japanese art of miniature sand landscapes. A teapot and cup are served on a tray with a pristine surface of sand -- and a tiny rake.
"This is like your tactile therapy or sand therapy, where guests will break the sand first, and then we serve a warm cocktail," said Pang.
Similar to a hot toddy, the drink has "healing power" thanks to its TCM-inspired recipe, comprising mezcal, snake soup, chicken broth, ginger beer, orange juice, rosemary and honey.
Another herbal creation is Retrospect, a variation of the classic Bamboo cocktail that uses rice vodka to bring out the nutty flavour of sherry.
It incorporates a simple version of the positive affirmations used in conception therapy. The drink is served in a box with a mirror, with the waiter telling the guest: "Just like you, the drink is stronger than you think."
"Retrospect" was Pang's original idea for the bar's name, as he wanted it to be a safe space where guests can slow down and look back. But he eventually settled on "spectre", inspired by Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Carl Jung's concept of a shadow self.
"Everyone carries a shadow and we interpret that as our mental state, something usually unseen," he said. "So we want to create a safe space, not so much to fix anyone, but for guests to be comfortable and befriend their 'shadows'."
Pang also believes a good cocktail should create talking points that allow tipplers to express themselves, whether to friends or bartenders.
One cocktail in the spice section, Question, aims to do just that. It features both whisky and floral brandy with green anise, star anise, cinnamon, cloves and pepper. But the real spice comes once it is served, when Pang or the bartender guides the guest through a light-hearted questionnaire that might shed light on their unconscious minds.
"I share my own answers with each table that I host, so that they feel more connected with me in the bar, and they might feel a sense of community too," said Pang.
He plans to turn Bar Spectre into a platform where people can talk about mental health and build communities. For instance, "happy hour" will offer not the usual cut-price drinks, but workshops such as art jamming, paired with wine or whiskey tasting.

China Punishes Bad Debtors: No Fast Trains or Nice Hotels
: Spegele, Brian. 
: FOSHAN, China -- Qin Huangsheng once imagined a better life in the city when she left her home village to become a factory worker at age 16.
Now, in her early 40s, she has $40,000 in personal debt and a base salary of $400 a month. Debt collectors are hounding her. She is blocked from buying tickets on China's high-speed rail, just one of the penalties the government is increasingly imposing on people who don't pay their bills.
On the aging slow trains she is left to ride, Qin sometimes looks at the other passengers and thinks: "I wonder if they're all bad debtors like me."
People across China are being weighed down by their debts and a system that penalizes them for not paying the money back. Beijing is cracking down on delinquent debtors by seizing their salaries or restricting them from getting government jobs, as well as curbing their access to high-speed trains and air travel. Many are forbidden from buying expensive insurance policies and told they aren't allowed to go on vacation or stay in nice hotels. Authorities can detain them if they don't comply.
The number of people on a publicly available government delinquency blacklist has jumped by nearly 50% since late 2019, to 8.3 million today. Courts can put people on the blacklist when they don't fulfill judgments against them to pay money back or are deemed to be not cooperating with legal proceedings.
Unlike in the U.S., China doesn't allow most people to declare bankruptcy to write off bad debts and move on with their lives, a policy some Chinese scholars are criticizing as unfair.
Household debt has surged by 50% in the past five years, to around $11 trillion. While that is lower than the $17.5 trillion Americans owe, it is a huge sum in a country where people earn far less.
With home prices falling, deflation risks becoming entrenched and unemployment a persistent challenge, Chinese leaders are eager to get people spending more. But funds going to pay for debt take away from those that could be used to splurge on new clothes or pay for a vacation. The threat of punishment for falling behind on debt is making many families more conservative with their money.
Retail sales of consumer goods in China rose 4.7% year-over-year in the first quarter, the government said Tuesday, lagging behind total economic growth of 5.3%. As many in China curtail spending, the government is giving priority to turbocharging manufacturing and exports, a strategy that is exacerbating trade tensions with the West.
With so many Chinese consumers under financial pressure, Western companies including Apple, Estee Lauder and General Motors have reported weaker sales in China.
Chinese officials didn't respond to questions about the blacklisting system. The government has said previously it only seeks to target those who have the ability to repay their debts but refuse to do so.
China's long housing boom was a significant cause of the rise in personal debts, because many people had to borrow more to afford homes. Some buyers took on extra debt to buy more properties for investment purposes. Now that the boom is over and prices are falling, many are stuck with debts they can't handle.
The number of foreclosed homes listed for sale rose 43% in 2023 to about 400,000 properties, according to real-estate research firm China Index Academy.
The increase in personal debts is also partly a result of more people using credit cards or tapping personal credit lines to handle expenses as the economy stagnates.
Many economists said a U.S.-style financial crisis is unlikely in China soon. State control of the banking system means the government can absorb losses and inject capital in an emergency. Household debts have also largely plateaued over the past two years, as many people give priority to using extra cash to pay down liabilities rather than shopping or investing in stocks.
The prevalence of large personal debts is a problem for China's leadership.
"Household debt booms tend to lead to bad macroeconomic outcomes, even in the absence of a financial crisis," said Amir Sufi, a University of Chicago economist. China has no simple fix. "Once the cycle starts, it's usually one in which it's painful, long and difficult to predict when it will end," Sufi said.
China has tried for years to lift personal spending to ease its economy's traditional reliance on infrastructure and real-estate growth. Its banks issued tens of millions of new credit cards each year, with outstanding balances jumping 50% between 2018 and 2023 to well over $1 trillion. Private technology apps such as Alipay and WeChat also started helping consumers secure loans as their digital payment systems soared in popularity.
But when debts go unpaid, a person's income can be seized by the state to cover their liabilities, leaving debtors with a small allowance.
A 38-year-old man petitioned courts in the southern city of Guangzhou to raise his monthly allowance to 12,000 yuan, equivalent to around $1,600, from 9,500 yuan to help pay for a newborn child. Judges denied his request late last year, and instead concluded that his allowance should be cut by nearly 40% because he was already getting too much, court records show.
A black market has emerged to serve people on the blacklist. In one case, Shanghai authorities busted a ring of scalpers who were booking high-speed rail tickets on behalf of debtors who were barred from doing so. In early 2021, authorities tracked down a debtor who had been using the service and took him into custody, according to a local court.
The current system gives priority to protecting creditors -- often powerful, state-owned institutions -- at the expense of helping struggling individuals. Scholars who study the issue said China urgently needs a nationwide personal-bankruptcy system to achieve leader Xi Jinping's goal of making the country more equitable, by forcing creditors and debtors to share the costs of soured loans.
"A personal-bankruptcy system is a mechanism for the redistribution of wealth," Li Shuguang, a scholar who has advised the government on bankruptcy policy, wrote in a Chinese magazine commentary online last summer.
Movement on the issue has been stymied in part by opponents who believe such a system would only encourage more people to shirk their debts.
For Qin, the former factory worker, easy access to credit backfired badly.
As a 16-year-old in 1999, Qin boarded an overnight bus to the grimy manufacturing hub of Dongguan, north of Hong Kong, from her home in rural southern China.
Her parents, who are farmers, couldn't afford a payment of less than $15 needed for her to take a high-school entrance exam. She vowed to make it on her own and found work in factories.
A few years later, Qin secured her first credit card. With it, she bought a computer to teach herself to type so she could land a better job. When the bill was paid, Qin said she tried to cancel the card. "Keep it for an emergency," the bank clerk told her.
Qin's career flourished and she eventually moved to the metropolis of Guangzhou. By 2010, she said, she was managing bidding for a company that supplied fire-safety equipment to real-estate projects. Her nest egg steadily grew from lucrative commissions.
When the property sector slowed, she jumped industries. An acquaintance had been involved in a startup that was developing software to help small-business owners collect WeChat data to generate more foot traffic and aid marketing efforts.
Qin said she invested the equivalent of around $150,000 of her savings into the venture. The startup burned through her initial investment as it tried to get the software up and running. Qin said she then agreed to start putting some of its expenses, including office supplies, rent and employee salaries, on her credit cards, and to tap personal credit lines she had obtained via WeChat and Alipay.
A roadshow by the company was warmly received, she said. But its prospects dimmed after the pandemic hit.
The company's struggles left Qin with tens of thousands of dollars of debt. Phone calls from debt collectors have become a daily occurrence.
With no option of bankruptcy, Qin concluded that a new job was her only way out of trouble. "As long as I'm still living and have a life, I can work hard to earn the money back."
That path has faced unexpected difficulties. In 2021, while preparing for a business trip to Shanghai, more than 700 miles northeast of Guangzhou, Qin realized she had lost her access to high-speed rail, where a government I.D. is required to buy a ticket. She took the slow train -- and later quit that job in part because the travel restrictions were making it impossible.
Local officials didn't respond to questions about Qin's case, and The Wall Street Journal wasn't able to verify some details of her account.
Today, Qin is working in a shop in Foshan, south of Guangzhou, selling traditional Chinese medicines. With a base salary of about $400 a month, she has found it tough to put a dent in her debts, but said she has managed to pay back two of her credit cards so far, with about $40,000 still to go.
Qin is trying to stay optimistic, hoping that medicine will be in high demand as China's population ages, opening the door to bonuses and potentially even running her own shop. Still, she has had to get creative to earn the cash to pay her debts.
Her current role requires Qin to collect payments from customers using a digital wallet on WeChat. But she said that function on her account has been frozen several times since 2022, leaving Qin to seek help from her family.
She decided not to tell her parents about the full scale of her troubles, however. If they knew the truth, Qin said, they "wouldn't be able to sleep."

China's Punishment for People With Bad Debts: No Fast Trains or Nice Hotels; Beijing's crackdown on millions of delinquent debtors makes catching up on unpaid bills a slog
: Spegele, Brian. 
: FOSHAN, China—Qin Huangsheng once imagined a better life in the city when she left her home village to become a factory worker at age 16.
Now, in her early 40s, she has $40,000 in personal debt and a base salary of $400 a month. Debt collectors are hounding her. She is blocked from buying tickets on China's high-speed rail, just one of the penalties the government is increasingly imposing on people who don't pay their bills.
On the aging slow trains she is left to ride, Qin sometimes looks at the other passengers and thinks: "I wonder if they're all bad debtors like me."
People across China are being weighed down by their debts and a system that penalizes them for not paying the money back. Beijing is cracking down on delinquent debtors by seizing their salaries or restricting them from getting government jobs, as well as curbing their access to high-speed trains and air travel. Many are forbidden from buying expensive insurance policies and told they aren't allowed to go on vacation or stay in nice hotels. Authorities can detain them if they don't comply.
The number of people on a publicly available government delinquency blacklist has jumped by nearly 50% since late 2019 to 8.3 million today. Courts can put people on the blacklist when they don't fulfill judgments against them to pay money back or are deemed to be not cooperating with legal proceedings.
Unlike in the U.S., China doesn't allow most people—including those who had a run of bad luck—to declare bankruptcy to write off bad debts and move on with their lives, a policy some Chinese scholars are criticizing as unfair.
Household debt has surged by 50% in the past five years to around $11 trillion today. While that is lower than the $17.5 trillion Americans owe, it is a huge sum in a country where people earn far less.
With home prices falling, deflation risks becoming entrenched and unemployment a persistent challenge , Chinese leaders are eager to get people spending more. But each additional dollar going to pay for debt is taking away one that could be used to splurge on new clothes or pay for a vacation. The threat of punishment for falling behind on debt is making many families more conservative with their money.
Retail sales of consumer goods in China rose 4.7% year-over-year in the first quarter, the government said Tuesday, lagging behind total economic growth of 5.3%. As many in China curtail spending, the government is giving priority to turbocharging manufacturing and exports, a strategy that is exacerbating trade tensions with the West.
With so many Chinese consumers under financial pressure, Western companies including Apple, Estée Lauder and General Motors have reported weaker sales in China .
Chinese officials didn't respond to questions about the blacklisting system. The government has said previously it only seeks to target those who have the ability to repay their debts but refuse to do so.
Behind China's personal-debt surge
China's long housing boom was a significant cause of the rise in personal debts, because many people had to borrow more to afford homes. Some buyers took on extra debt to buy more properties for investment purposes, sometimes letting them sit empty. Now that the boom is over and prices are falling , many are stuck with debts they can't handle.
The number of foreclosed homes listed for sale rose 43% in 2023 to roughly 400,000 properties, according to real-estate research firm China Index Academy.
The increase in personal debts is also partly a result of more people using credit cards or tapping personal credit lines to handle expenses as the economy stagnates.
Many economists say a U.S.-style financial crisis is unlikely in China soon. State control of the banking system means the government can absorb losses and inject capital in an emergency. Household debts have also largely plateaued over the past two years, as many people give priority to using extra cash to pay down liabilities rather than shopping or investing in stocks.
Still, the prevalence of large personal debts is a problem for China's leadership.
"Household debt booms tend to lead to bad macroeconomic outcomes, even in the absence of a financial crisis," said Amir Sufi, a University of Chicago economist. China has no simple fix. "Once the cycle starts, it's usually one in which it's painful, long and difficult to predict when it will end," Sufi said.
A tough system for borrowers
China has tried for years to lift personal spending to ease its economy's traditional reliance on infrastructure and real-estate growth. Its banks issued tens of millions of new credit cards each year, with outstanding balances jumping 50% between 2018 and 2023 to well over $1 trillion. Private technology apps such as Alipay and WeChat also started helping consumers secure loans as their digital payment systems soared in popularity.
But when debts go unpaid, a person's income can be seized by the state to cover their liabilities, leaving debtors with a small allowance to scrape by.
A 38-year-old man petitioned courts in the southern city of Guangzhou to raise his monthly allowance to 12,000 yuan, equivalent to around $1,600, from 9,500 yuan to help pay for a newborn child. Judges denied his request late last year, and instead concluded that his allowance should be cut by nearly 40% because he was already getting too much, court records show.

One woman's saga
For Qin, the former factory worker, easy access to credit backfired badly.
As a 16-year-old in 1999, Qin boarded an overnight bus from her home in rural southern China to the grimy manufacturing hub of Dongguan, north of Hong Kong.
Her parents, who are farmers, couldn't afford a payment of less than $15 needed for her to take a high-school entrance exam. She vowed to make it on her own, and found work in factories producing slippers and golden jewelry.
A few years later, Qin secured her first credit card. With it, she bought a computer to teach herself to type so she could land a better job.
When the bill was paid, Qin said she tried to cancel the card. "Keep it for an emergency," the bank clerk told her.
Qin's career flourished and she eventually moved to the metropolis of Guangzhou. By 2010, she said, she was managing bidding for a company that supplied fire-safety equipment to real-estate projects. Her nest egg steadily grew from the lucrative commissions she earned in the property boom.

Asia: Episode 3: The Science of Social
: Podcast Free Asia
So in the intro, Eugene wanted to push a nickname for the RFA Insider cohosts and thus came up with the "Insider Crew" and later "The Insiders." Amy was scripted to have a negative reaction to it, but secretly she probably thinks one of those is kind of cool.
Eugene explained that the webpage is currently under construction but it is now in a functional state. He also made a correction about calling the Vietnamese film "Mai" a romantic comedy in episode 2. It's more accurate to call it a romantic drama with comedic elements.
The Rundown
The Lao Service reported how authorities rescued 16 black bear cubs whose bile was harvested for use in Chinese traditional medicine, and a Chinese man who was found with the cubs in his office is now on the run. Moon bear bile is a cooling medicine and said to prevent gallstones and improve liver function and even improve eyesight.
The Cantonese and Mandarin Services reported that Chinese nationalists called the "little pinks" think that a Chinese drink manufacturer is too Japanese, because it has a water bottle with a red cap, which they saw as a representation of the Japanese flag, some of their teas have a temple on their label, which they said looks like a Japanese temple, and their fruity teas have the greek letter ð (pi), which they say looks like the torii gates outside Tokyo's Yasukuni jinja, the shrine that commemorates Japan's war dead, including some convicted war criminals, and it gets a rise out of many Koreans and Chinese whenever it's visited by Japanese politicians.
Eugene took issue with the assertion that the temple on the label was Japanese, invoking his expertise conferred upon him by traditional architecture test on the website alllooksame.com, where he scored 14/18, and therefore thinks he knows what he is talking about when identifying East Asian temples. (Note: alllooksame.com is not affiliated in any way with Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Asia does not necessarily endorse any of that website's content.)
How it's made
Joining us in the studio this time was "Wilson," who is not a bloodstained volleyball from the 2000 film "Castaway" starring Tom Hanks, but who is a social media editor at Radio Free Asia. Wilson explained to us why RFA's social media presence is very popular in some countries, what makes a particular post perform well on social media, and how RFA as a news organization navigates changes in policy from the leading social media platforms, as well as other engaging topics related to social media. Wilson is a pseudonym that he uses whenever he is at Starbucks, because he does not like to spell out his name. He is also using it here to protect his identity, as many RFA journalists in the language services do.

I leveraged my blog to create a $14 million wellness brand by focusing on content strategy and personal growth
: Hardy, Elle. 
: - A blogger turned wellness influencer and CEO Olivia Amitrano started her business with only $200.
- She said the best way to grow a blog is to use captivating titles, listicles, and specific solutions.
- Her supplement business, Organic Olivia, now brings in about $14 million in revenue every year.
- This article is part of " Unlocking Small Business Success , " a series providing micro businesses with a road map to growth.
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Olivia Amitrano, a 29-year-old wellness entrepreneur from New York City. The following has been edited for length and clarity.
I grew up with health problems that I always thought were connected, including skin and gut issues and some anxiety. We know now that there's a gut-brain axis, but at the time, the doctors I went to kept telling me my issues weren't related.
This motivated me to enter Fordham University as a premed student in 2011. Even though I eventually realized traditional, or integrative, medicine was my true calling, the statistics and research classes I took turned out to be extremely helpful later in my career. After one year, I switched majors to psychology and graduated in 2015.
Now I'm a wellness influencer with 480,000 Instagram followers and 120,000 TikTok followers. I also have my own supplement line that brought in $14 million in revenue in 2020, my highest-grossing year yet. Here's how I built my business.
From my teens to early 20s, I was stressed out and sick, and my doctors said they couldn't do anything
One day in 2012, I left school and drove myself to an acupuncturist who practiced traditional Chinese medicine. He took one look at my tongue and noted every symptom I was experiencing. He also prescribed me herbs that gave me more relief over the next week than anything else I'd tried.
After that visit, I started a blog detailing my journey. I began experimenting with herbs and seeing more alternative-health practitioners. I wanted to explain to people what worked for me to fix my issues, the diet changes I was making, and why.
In 2013, I tried to monetize the blog, but there wasn't much information about affiliate marketing at the time, and influencers weren't big yet. All I could do was post Amazon affiliate links for different herbs, skincare, and home products I blogged about, which made me anywhere from a few cents to a dollar per sale. I made $200 to $500 a month on average.
I grew my blog using specific strategies
Blog titles are critical. People are inundated with digital grabs for their very short attention spans, so you need to convince your audience in seconds that this topic is going to be easy to understand, fun to read, and valuable.
The most high-value content provides solutions, so ensure your article is solving a real and specific problem for your audience. Instead of writing about a skincare product you're loving, write about a skincare product that has helped you with a specific skin complaint or condition such as eczema.
Structure, format, and quantify your articles. It's easy and fun for our brains to contain things in neat, digestible bits, and lists help break up long articles.
Naming my blog posts "Everything I Wish I Knew About _____" has been an effective format, particularly on TikTok and Instagram reels. One of my blogs in this style, adapted from a reel that got 329,000 views, had "protein, calories, and hormones" in the blank, and it performed well on my site.
Other topics that performed well for me were digestion, cutting out sugar, aphrodisiac herbs, and preventing cognitive decline.
In 2013, I decided to write an e-book to help accelerate my business
I was working a series of side jobs, and I had $200 to my name. I spent it all at Trader Joe's buying ingredients to make my favorite juice recipes to test and photograph them. The juice-recipe book made about $4,000 over three months, and I plowed all of that back into the business.
The key was starting very small with digital products since they have such low overhead and eventually putting that money into physical products. I started working on my supplement line in 2016 and named my business Organic Olivia.
In 2017, I started at ArborVitae School of Traditional Herbalism in Brooklyn
I wanted to understand the science and traditional wisdom that could explain why the herbs I was using for my health conditions were so effective. I also wanted the credentials, knowledge base, and real-world experience to formulate my own products and be taken seriously in the supplement and wellness world.
I completed a three-year intensive clinical program in 2020, where I learned how to formulate herbal remedies with the right therapeutic dose and complementary herbs.
Manufacturing supplements was a huge learning curve
I was lucky to have a friend who had worked in food manufacturing who explained the dos and don'ts of the industry to me and pointed out some of the corruption that exists.
I then met a great manufacturer at a supplement conference called Expo West who helped me navigate tricks in the industry, and we worked together as co-formulators. We also ensured our 33 products, which range in price from $25 to $79, were tested and certified by a reputable lab.
I've never taken investor money and now have nine full-time employees.
As an influencer, I promote my own formulas
I was an early adopter of Instagram and was really part of the first "generation" of influencers, but I don't take sponsorships. I make commissions from affiliates, but I've never promoted something because a company approached me, which helps me maintain trust with my audience.
Instead of putting 100 products in front of my followers, they can trust my line of supplements because we've built a relationship.
Maintaining my blog has been a big part of my success. Researching and writing content doesn't directly translate to revenue, but it's important that it's my voice because the brand is my face and philosophy.
The biggest mistakes I've made were spending too much on web-agency fees instead of hiring my own developer and keeping employees who weren't working out because I wanted to be nice. Not only did it hit me financially, but it impacted the company's energy and culture.

Singapore: HSA ALERT: Gu Jie Ling Found to Contain Potent Medicinal Ingredients; One Consumer Experienced Serious Adverse Effects
: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is alerting members of the public not to purchase or consume ßèË (Gu Jie Ling). HSA's analysis of the product found that it contained a potent steroid, dexamethasone, which led to a consumer developing Cushing's syndrome (a serious steroid-induced condition characterised by a 'moon face' appearance and several other medical complications). The product was also tested to contain cetirizine, an antihistamine. Please refer to Annex A for photos of the product analysed by HSA.
2 A woman in her 60s was found with Cushingoid symptoms (round and puffy face) and low blood pressure after being admitted to hospital for other medical conditions. Further investigations revealed that her blood cortisol levels were low[1] and that she had gained weight one month prior to hospitalisation. She was diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome. She informed her doctor that she had been taking ßèË (Gu Jie Ling) for several months to relieve her foot pain. The product was recommended by her husband's friend who had purchased it from a traditional medicine shop in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.
3 ßèË(Gu Jie Ling) was labelled as a traditional medicine containing various herbal ingredients. It claimed to be made entirely from traditional Chinese medicines, had no side effects and can be safely used for symptomatic relief of backache, joint and muscular pain. Contrary to these claims, HSA's analysis detected potent medicinal ingredients, dexamethasone (steroid) and cetirizine (antihistamine), in the product. The product was also labelled with a Malaysian product registration number which gave the impression that the product was registered by the Malaysian health authority. However, the registration number stated was not valid based on HSA's checks on the Malaysian health authority's website, suggesting that it may be an illegal product. HSA has alerted its Malaysian counterpart to this product.
Possible harmful effects of the potent medicinal ingredients
4 Dexamethasone is a potent steroid that is usually prescribed for inflammatory conditions and should only be used under strict medical supervision. Long-term unsupervised use of steroids can cause increased blood sugar levels (which may lead to diabetes), high blood pressure, cataracts, muscular and bone disorders, an increased risk of infections and Cushing's syndrome. Sudden discontinuation of steroids without proper medical supervision can cause serious withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue, confusion and low blood pressure. Cetirizine is an antihistamine used to relieve allergic reactions and should be used under medical supervision. Adverse effects from the use of cetirizine include drowsiness, fatigue, headache and dry mouth.
Advisory to consumers
5 Consumers are advised to:
See a doctor as soon as possible if you are taking ßèË (Gu Jie Ling) as it contains a potent steroid. Do not stop taking the product on your own as sudden stopping of the product without medical supervision may result in the worsening of underlying medical conditions or other serious withdrawal conditions.
Be wary of products carrying exaggerated claims such as no side effects as they can contain potent ingredients that can seriously harm your health.
Do not buy products from unknown or unverifiable sources, and exercise caution when buying from overseas, or even from well-meaning friends or relatives, as you cannot be certain where and how these products were made and whether they have been adulterated with harmful ingredients. Adulterated products are often manufactured under poor conditions with no quality control. They may also falsely claim to be registered in a particular country. Hence you should only buy products from reputable pharmacies or retailers' websites or those with an established retail presence in Singapore.
Always consult your doctor or pharmacist if you need help to manage your chronic medical conditions (such as joint pain).
Advisory to sellers and suppliers
6 All sellers and suppliers must stop selling this product immediately. HSA will not hesitate to take stern enforcement actions against anyone who sells and supplies products found to be adulterated with potent medicinal ingredients. Sellers and suppliers are liable to prosecution and if convicted, may be imprisoned for up to 2 years and/or fined up to $10,000.

Kara Arissa Tan: Preserving a food legacy
: Helmi. 
: AS A SECOND-GENERATION LEADER in a traditional food industry, Kara Arissa Tan has a lot weighing on her petite shoulders. In 2021, she conceived and co-founded Zhen, a modern bird's nest company offering ethically-farmed 100 per cent pure bird's nest in a range of forms and flavours. Since then, the CEO has embarked on an unstoppable mission to distinguish Zhen as a leader in manufacturing bird's nest products entirely in Singapore.
She says: "Unlike others claiming Singaporean origin, we own the entire process, from our birdhouses to the final product. We pride ourselves on not outsourcing any part of our production, ensuring a high level of transparency and control throughout the manufacturing process."
Her father Eric had founded Masterdon Swiftlets Resources in 1986, which today owns 27 bird's nest houses across South-east Asia and supplies traditional hand-cleaned unprocessed bird's nest to many companies. But growing up, Tan dreamt of driving the family business forward by offering pure bird's nest directly to the consumer. "I wanted us to become known not just as a supplier but also as a manufacturer of bird's nest delicacies," she says.
As her father goes into semi-retirement, Tan -- the only child -- is poised to take over the reins of Masterdon too. Though she's only 30, she is more than ready to lead both companies, having worked for Masterdon in various part-time and full-time capacities since young.
"At six years of age, I learnt how to clean the nest of swiftlets, picking out the dirt and feathers carefully and thoroughly," she says. "Over the years, I interned in the company's various departments so that I could learn to do everything, from marketing to manufacturing."
Level-headed leadership She says this without a hint of arrogance, having been instilled the values of hard work, modesty, pragmatism and kindness to others by what she describes as "traditional and strict Chinese parents". To wit, she still goes to the office on weekdays before 9 am and doesn't leave before 6.30 pm. On Saturdays, she works half-days without fail.
In fact, Tan recounts how, as a teenager, she was so fearful of her parents that she chose not to tell them about the financial problems she faced while studying in the UK. Instead, she took up three different jobs -- at a clothing store, bubble tea shop and Chinese restaurant -- to make up for the shortfall.
She explains: "I trusted a friend with regard to our student housing arrangements and he failed to honour the agreement so I lost a lot of money. Because the fault was entirely mine, I didn't want to burden my parents by asking for money. I took full ownership of the situation by juggling three jobs instead."
Even today, her parents refuse to spoil her. "I drive a Mercedes-Benz S-Class hand-me-down from my father. He won't buy me a new car. He says if I want one, I'd have to save for it myself."
She credits her father's discipline and restraint for making her self-reliant and resourceful. When she co-founded Zhen with him, she chose to create her own recipes instead of relying on a research and development team. She tested the recipes on friends and families, and finally launched Zhen -- meaning "precious treasure" -- during the height of the pandemic. At a time when people were cautious about travelling, Tan took it upon herself to personally deliver the orders to their homes.
This allowed her to interact directly with her customers and get feedback on the products, available as drinks in natural floral botanical flavours such as chamomile, chrysanthemum and lemongrass, as well as collagen jelly in flavours such as mango, peach and strawberry.
As word of mouth grew, Zhen was able to ramp up production and sell many more bottles in 2023 compared to 2022. Tan now sees 2024 "as the year we carry out more research and development into combining bird's nests with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), so we can capture the TCM market as well".
Steamboat and luck As Chinese New Year approaches, Tan can't wait for the feast that always accompanies the occasion. "I love having hot pot almost every day of the New Year celebrations. Throughout the year, we don't often have hot pot unless we go to HaiDiLao... So to be able to eat hot pot throughout the day as our relatives and friends stream in is simply my favourite part of Chinese New Year."
Sheepishly, she adds: "I also have a habit of testing my new bird's nest recipes on my relatives and getting honest feedback from them. In the past, I'd steam papaya and pear, and serve them with bird's nest as a kind of dessert. One time, I even tried to pair bird's nest with alcohol -- though that didn't go down so well. So this Chinese New Year, I might try out some of my TCM recipes to see what they have to say."
Asked if the Year of the Dragon is auspicious for those born in the Year of the Rooster such as her, Tan smiles and says: "No matter how superstitious I am about these matters, I believe I still have to work for it. Even if the year promises to bring the best of luck for roosters, if I'm not working hard to make the best of it, it's just not going to work. Good year or bad year, I'm still putting in the work and the hours."
As a young custodian of a cherished food tradition, Tan's words assure you that at least this segment of the bird's nest industry is being thoroughly safeguarded.

Vietnam-China: Vietnam-China joint statement on Chinese leader's visit

The joint statement was released on the occasion of General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping's state visit to Vietnam.
Following is the English translation of the joint statement by the Vietnam News Agency:
1. Accepting the invitation of General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee Nguyn Phú Trng and President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Võ Vãn Thüng, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping pays a state visit to Vietnam from December 12-13, 2023.
During the visit, General Secretary and President Xi Jinping holds talks with General Secretary Nguyn Phú Trng and President Võ Vãn Thüng, and meets with Prime Minister Phm Minh Chính, National Assembly Chairman Vüõng Ðình Hu.
The two sides hold that Vietnam and China are good neighbours, good friends, good comrades, and good partners, and both are socialist countries under the leadership of a communist party, with similar political regimes, compatible ideology and belief, similar development path, shared vision, shared future, and common efforts for happy people and a wealthy and strong country and for the noble cause of peace and progress of mankind.
To inherit and promote the traditional friendship of "Vietnam-China close bonds as both comrades and brothers" and continue to deepen and further elevate the Vietnam-China Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership, the two sides agree to build a Vietnam-China Community with a Shared Future having strategic significance and exert efforts for the happiness of the two peoples and for the cause of peace and progress of mankind.
The Vietnamese side supports the building of community with shared future for mankind, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilisation Initiative. These initiatives have the aim of protecting the common interest of the whole mankind, for the cause of peace, fairness and progressiveness of people all over the world, meeting the aspiration to build a better world of people in all countries.
The two sides reach consensus that the development of relations among states should comply with the United Nations' Charter, international law and essential norms of international relations, persist with mutual respect, equality, mutual benefits, win-win cooperation, respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and persist with the settlement of differences through peaceful measures.
Following the above-mentioned orientations, the two sides agree to take the Vietnam-China relations to a new stage with stronger political trust, more substantial defence-security cooperation, deeper tangible collaboration, firmer social foundation, closer multilateral coordination, better management and settlement of differences, and joint efforts for boosting the development of the world socialism cause, making positive contributions to the cause of peace and progress of mankind.
2. In a friendly, straightforward atmosphere, the two sides inform each other on the situations of their respective Parties, countries, as well as the theory and reality of the building of socialism; showing delight at the great and historic achievements that each Party, country has gained during the cause of national development, modernisation and socialism building in line with each country's conditions; asserting that these fully demonstrate the vitality and superiority of the socialist regimes in Vietnam and China.
The Vietnamese side warmly congratulates the great accomplishments that the Party, Government and people of China have made during the 10-year new era as well as important achievements during the realisation of the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress. The Vietnamese side wishes and believes that under the firm leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the nucleus, following the orientations of the Xi Jinping Thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, the Party, Government and people of China will certainly continue to diversify and expand the path of Chinese-style modernisation, unceasingly perfect the whole-process people's democracy, strongly promote the new great project on Party building, complete on schedule all targets and tasks set at the 20th CPC National Congress, successfully implement the Second Centenary Goal, turning China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful.
China supports and highly values achievements made by Vietnam over nearly 40 years of Ði mi, 10 years of the implementation of the Platform on national construction during the transitional period toward socialism (supplemented and amended in 2011), especially the important and comprehensive accomplishments made since the CPV's 13th National Congress to date, which have propelled Vietnam's synergy and international influence to unprecedented heights. China wishes and believes that under the sound leadership of the CPV Central Committee led by General Secretary Nguyn Phú Trng, the Party, State and people of Vietnam will certainly realise major goals and tasks set at the 13th National Congress of the CPV, build Vietnam into a socialist-oriented developed country with high income by 2045. China affirms its support for Vietnam's prosperous development, well-being of its people, building of a strong, independent and self-reliant economy, promotion of the cause of ði mi, industrialisation, modernisation and comprehensive international integration, development of open and friendly foreign relations, and an increasingly important role in peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region and the world.
3. The two sides look back at the development process of relations between the two Parties and countries, appreciate the invaluable and selfless support that the two Parties, countries and their people have provided for each other in various periods; unanimously agree that the traditional friendship as "both comrades and brothers" founded and nurtured by President Ho Chi Minh and President Mao Zedong and generations of leaders, is an invaluable asset of the two countries' people that needs to be inherited, well-protected, and effectively upheld. The Party, State and people of Vietnam always hold in high regard and deeply appreciate the strong support and assistance provided by the Party, State and people of China in the struggle for national liberation and independence, as well as the cause of socialism building and national development.
At the turn of the century, Vietnam and China set up the motto "friendly neighbourliness, comprehensive cooperation, long-term stability, looking toward the future and the spirit of "good neighbours, good friends, good comrades, good partners". Fifteen years since the establishment of their comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership in 2008, cooperation in various fields has made positive and comprehensive progress. Entering a new era, the Vietnam-China relationship has kept expanding and deepening, especially with Vietnamese Party General Secretary Nguyn Phú Trng's historic visit to China at the invitation of Chinese Party General Secretary and President Xi Jinping following the CPC's 20th National Congress, which elevated Vietnam-China ties to a greater height.
Looking toward the future, China highlights its consistent policy of friendship with Vietnam, considering Vietnam a priority in its neighbourhood diplomacy. Vietnam affirms that the Vietnam-China relationship is always a top priority in its foreign policy of independence, self-reliance, multilateralisation and diversification of external ties. It is a strategic choice of both sides.
Both sides affirm their consistent support for the two Parties, countries and their people to persevere with independence in strategy and choice of development paths that suit each country's situation; be persistent in properly handling and actively resolving disagreements through peaceful means on the basis of mutual understanding, mutual respect in accordance with international law, maintaining the good development momentum of Vietnam-China relations, making more active contributions to peace, stability and development in the region and the world.
On the basis of the above common perceptions, in the context of rapid, complicated, unpredictable and unprecedented developments in the world, both sides agree to persist with political orientations of the highest Party and State leaders, looking at and developing the Vietnam-China relationship from a strategic height and long-term perspective in accordance with the "16 words" motto and the spirit of "4 goods", taking the 15th anniversary of their comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership as an opportunity to build the Vietnam-China community with a shared future of strategic importance, striving for the well-being of their people, and for the sake of peace and progress of humanity.

____________________________________________________________
I'm an American who lived in Asia for 7 years. I experienced reverse culture shock when I moved back home.
: Lyle, Sara. 
: - Sara Lyle moved from New York to Singapore after having never visited the city-state before.
- The culture shock she faced after moving to Asia included adjusting to the locals' bluntness.
- Upon returning to the US seven years later, she was surprised by how "foreign" it felt to be back.
Before moving to Singapore eight years ago, I heard it described as "Asia Lite" or "Asia for Beginners" partly because — compared with, say, China or Vietnam — almost everyone there speaks English, one of its four national languages, along with Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil.
The city-state also tends to be more accessible to outsiders thanks to its modern infrastructure, cleanliness, and safety. Boasting the world's best airport, travelers use it as a convenient gateway to exploring the region.
This reputation was why I felt comfortable enough to board a 23-hour flight from New York City to Singapore, sight unseen, at six-months pregnant, and start a life on the other side of the planet.
Upon arrival, however, I was taken aback by different Singaporean traditions and traits. One example was the bluntness often used by locals. Taxi drivers, without hesitation, would ask how much I paid in rent during the ride. Likewise, upon learning that I was an American, various strangers and new acquaintances would come right out with, "Do you like Obama?" and, eventually, "What do you think of Trump?" Generally speaking, people in America don't lead with these types of personal or political questions.
I was also unfamiliar with certain customs, such as handing out business cards with both hands, often with a slight head nod. This practice was part of nearly every business-related gathering.
After giving birth and landing a full-time job for the rest of my time there, I had so many business cards from such exchanges that I could have tossed them in the air like confetti during the New Year's Eve ball drop at Times Square.
But, despite these types of cultural adjustments, Singapore turned out to be the lovely place I imagined it would be, in large part because of the warm people — both citizens and non — who welcomed my son and me with open arms. When I moved back to my Florida hometown seven years later, Singapore felt as much like "home" as New York had before that.
What I wasn't expecting was to feel reverse culture shock so acutely. Sure, I had lived in the US most of my life and spoke the language, but everything, such as transportation, tipping, and wellness treatments, felt foreign. Here's what it's been like being back, first in Florida and now in Colorado, for the last year and a half.
Getting around took some getting used to
Most Americans outside big cities drive cars, and there's plenty of land to spare. I haven't lived in a major city since leaving Singapore, and I still miss its relative closeness. The island nation is only a little more than 275 square miles, similar in size to Jacksonville, Florida — although Singapore's population is five times the size.
During those years in Singapore, I used public transportation, biked, or walked from point A to point B — cabs were also affordable when needed. As owning a car was prohibitively expensive — it costs $76,000-plus just to get the right to buy a car there — it made financial sense not to drive while there.
Today, my son and I live in Colorado with my husband and two stepsons. And, as you might expect from the Rocky Mountain State, it has a car-based culture because of its hilly terrain and snowy winters, plus the fact that it's so spread out. I'm back to driving, and while it's not my favorite thing to do, I consider it part of my "cultural immersion" here. When in Rome, you know?
Getting back in the habit of tipping
Another thing I had to get used to in Singapore was not having to tip. For the first couple of months, if not years, it just felt "weird" and "wrong" not to tip cab drivers, waiters, bartenders, hair stylists, nail techs, and every other manner of service worker.
Now, when I'm dining out, I have to remind myself to add the standard 20% tip to the restaurant bill plus sales tax.
Missing Asian self-care staples
Once I moved back, I was quickly reminded that people in the US typically drink ice in their water — it's not even a choice at most restaurants. Despite the temperature in Singapore averaging 85 degrees year-round, more often than not, people opt for room-temperature or lukewarm water. One major reason: According to traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM, it's better for the digestive and circulatory systems and doesn't disrupt the body's natural balance.
Though I had gotten acupuncture before moving to Singapore, I didn't do it as fanatically. I ended up going to the same TCM doctor for years, visiting her house for regular acupuncture or cupping sessions, as well as to refill my prescription of herbal remedies.
Over time, she treated me for things as varied as stress, sleep issues, bloating, and head colds. When I broke my elbow in an inline skating fall, she was one of my first calls. Thanks to her close care, plus additional physical therapy and calcium supplements, my elbow returned to almost full function. No surgery was required.
While my health insurance didn't cover these types of "alternative" or "preventive" medicines there or here, the going rate for a licensed TCM doctor was about $30 an hour in Singapore. I haven't found any reputable clinics at a comparable price in the Denver suburbs around me.
In the end, it was only upon returning to my American roots that I realized how deeply intertwined my experiences in Singapore had become with my sense of "home." As the saying goes, "Home is where the heart is," and it appears mine resides in multiple places.

Samoa/China: Samoa wanted Chinese tourists - it got a dreamer and grifters instead
: When the first direct tourist flight from China to Samoa landed in the Pacific island country in late May, it was the culmination of years of effort to tap into the potentially lucrative Chinese market.
Top Samoan officials were at the international airport to welcome the first contingent of Chinese visitors, but the tours quickly ran into strife and the jubilation was short lived.
The flights and related business ventures targeting Samoa have links to several discredited business figures in China, an investigation by affiliated news organizations BenarNews and Radio Free Asia found.
The tourism venture was a stepping stone in plans that called for redeveloping Samoa into a haven for well-heeled immigrants branded as Eastern International Island on the website promoting these plans. They also sought to transform the country of 220,000 people into a cryptocurrency and stock trading center.
The ambitions are associated with two senior Samoan government ministers. They also attracted some support from Chinese officials, and were characterized as being part of the Belt and Road Initiative - China's sprawling plan to dot the globe with ports, railways and other infrastructure.
Although Samoa's prime minister appears to have sidelined the ventures, the lack of full accountability for government ministers continues to reverberate in the country. The mingling of political office and private business interests, the orbiting cast of grifters and the veneer of Chinese government backing resemble a playbook for how to exploit a developing island state.
Mulipola Anarosa Ale Molioo, who as Samoa's finance minister took part in the Hong Kong launch of a stock exchange, digital asset exchange and blockchain special economic zone for Samoa, was removed from that role and reassigned in a cabinet reshuffle in September. No reason was given for the specific reassignment.
When the launch took place in April at the luxury St. Regis hotel, Samoa's coat of arms was projected and plastered throughout the venue. Soon after, Samoa's Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa issued a statement saying the government had not approved the ventures.
Fiame, as part of the reshuffle, took over responsibility for tourism, a key industry for Samoa.
A key local link in the plans is Laauli Leuatea Polataivao Fosi, a cabinet minister and cofounder with Fiame of the new ruling party in Samoa.
The direct flights from China were stopped after criticism of Laauli's family ties to the Samoan company that with a Hong Kong partner controlled tours in Samoa for the influx of Chinese visitors. Laauli emerged unscathed from the reshuffle.
Some 50,000 acres of land were to be redeveloped in Samoa into 3,000 villas, 54 golf courses, hospitals, rehabilitation centers and other amenities, according to comments attributed to Yao Zhisheng, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, during a speech he made at the Hong Kong cryptocurrency launch.
The CPPCC has the coordinating role in the Chinese Communist Party's United Front work that includes foreign-influence campaigns.
Yao's comments are consistent with plans promoted since 2019 on the website of a Hong Kong-based company, Samoa Trade & Investment Promotion for Hong Kong and Asian countries, which was also the organizer of the cryptocurrency launch. It is connected to discredited businessman Chen Keen and claims to have thousands of acres of land in Samoa.
The trials of Jack Chen
Two of the Hong Kong and China-based figures involved in the plans are relatives of Chen Keen, who is known in Samoa and New Zealand as Jack Chen.
He's on trial in Hong Kong for money laundering and a U.S. $300 million fraud that took place in the Chinese territory and New Zealand in the late 2000s. It's his second retrial, according to court documents.
In 2016, he was sentenced in Hong Kong to nearly eight years in prison. The conviction was thrown out in 2019 because of a legal error in the indictment. A retrial in 2021 collapsed when a witness revealed Chen's previous conviction to the jury. The second retrial began in May this year.
One of the family members is Chen Gen, who is reported in mainland China to be Jack Chen's brother. Chen Gen is barred for life from holding any position in listed companies or securities businesses in China, according to the country's stock market regulator. The purported brothers faked the profits of a group of companies in the 2000s, regulatory statements show.
Chen Gen uses another name, Chen Kegen, and according to China's Enforcement Information Disclosure database, which was established by the country's Supreme Court, he has 25 instances of defaulting on debts and being subjected to restrictions on his spending since 2013.
A reward was offered this year for information of his whereabouts, shows an online wanted notice about a $700,000 debt that uses Chen Gen's other name Chen Kegen. Through roles with United Front-affiliated organizations such as overseas Chinese associations, Chen Gen projects another image - that of a do-gooder and patriot.
The other family member is Luna Chen. BenarNews has identified her as a daughter or other close female relative of Jack Chen, based on common residential addresses in New Zealand and Hong Kong, her age group and other corroborating details.
Luna Chen was the liaison person with Samoa for Travel Focus, a tour business based in Hong Kong that promoted the direct flights from Hainan to Samoa, and is one of the directors of Travel Focus.
She is also a director of the company that both organized the cryptocurrency launch and promoted the land redevelopment plans for Samoa, according to Hong Kong company records.
She is a director of another Hong Kong company, Big Fame, which is in a legal battle in the Chinese territory. A company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange alleged in a filing to the exchange last year that Big Fame had tried to extort money from it by filing a court petition for closure of the company.
Despite a problematic background that included a ban in China on being a company director, Jack Chen cultivated ties to the powerful in New Zealand and Samoa after moving to New Zealand in 2003.
In Samoa, he was bestowed a chief's title by Laauli's village, photos of the ceremony show, after reportedly donating money to Samoan rugby. The judge who sentenced Chen in 2016 said Samoa's prime minister at that time had written to the court vouching for Chen's good deeds in Samoa.
Luna Chen did not respond to emailed questions and wasn't in the office when called at a Hong Kong company she is a director of. The law firm representing Jack Chen in his retrial did not respond to two requests to contact him. Via an intermediary, Chen Gen provided a phone number and requested that he be contacted through the WeChat app, but did not answer calls or respond to messages.
Samoa has aspired for some time to have direct flights from China and more Chinese tourists. However, its tourism industry has found that Chinese who can afford to travel to Samoa are mostly not into the resort and beach experiences favored by the Kiwi and Australian visitors around which the tourism industry is built.
That's why we allowed the casino, said Member of Parliament Lealailepule Rimoni Aiafi, referring to two casino licenses issued about a decade ago.
So we've been working on this for a long time, he said in an interview with BenarNews. Then this thing came up. And then we look into it. We found out it's the same name that's been involved in all this - Jack Chen.
Lealailepule was part of Samoa's previous government, led by the Human Rights Protection Party - Samoa's ruling party for nearly 40 years until its election defeat in 2021. Fiame, the current prime minister, and Laauli are also former members of HRPP governments.
A third person involved in both the tourism and cryptocurrency and stock exchange ventures, as a director and promoter, is Zhu Hua, who runs a network of purported healthcare businesses in China.
Public records show that courts have ordered high-level consumption restrictions on Zhu on 90 occasions - most recently in April - that bar spending deemed as non-essential such as traveling by plane or high-speed train and staying in hotels above a certain quality. The measures are usually ordered in response to unpaid debts.
Chinese media reports have described Zhu's health businesses as a multi-level marketing or pyramid scheme.
In 2015, Zhu promoted an at-home test that claimed to detect cancer in five minutes. It aired on CCTV, the main state broadcaster in China.
Videos promoting Zhu's healthcare businesses feature technology that doesn't exist or that adds a high-tech twist to traditional Chinese medicine. In one, a woman's feet are bathed in red light inside an MRI-like machine while medical-textbook type illustrations of a brain appear on displays purportedly connected to the machine.
The pseudo science finds an echo on the website of the Hong Kong-based Samoa Trade & Investment Promotion organization. Alongside its photos of Jack Chen with Samoan officials such as Laauli, the site describes Samoa as a cancer-free country.
Attempts to contact Zhu via two companies he is associated with did not get a response.
Three other individuals that BenarNews identified as connected to the tourism and cryptocurrency ventures also have backgrounds with red flags for regulators. Until earlier this year, one of them headed a company that falsely claimed to be part of one of China's largest state-owned conglomerates.
Cabinet minister avoids interview
It's unclear what Mulipola, who became women's minister after the September cabinet reshuffle, understood about the status of the Hong Kong cryptocurrency event before she attended it. Photos show Mulipola on stage exchanging documents with Zhu and Chen Gen and seated with Chinese officials.
She agreed to an interview with BenarNews but canceled it as reporters waited in a meeting room at her office. An assistant said Mulipola had a sudden doctor's appointment.
Lauuli, over WhatsApp, said he only wanted to discuss new issues, new opportunities and new investment for Samoa. He was overseas when BenarNews carried out reporting in Apia over several days in late October and early November.
The stock and cryptocurrency exchange proposals, if ever realized, could be very dangerous for a small country like Samoa, said Lealailepule, the opposition politician.
We want to develop the country, everybody wants that, Lealailepule said. But we also need to make sure that we follow the rules and do what is best for the country, not for yourself or a few individuals.
Samoans had already been burned in 2018 and 2019 by the One Coin cryptocurrency scam which, the U.S. Department of Justice said, took $4.4 billion from victims worldwide. Shortcomings in financial literacy in Samoa and values that emphasize respect for authority figures and extended family mean that scams can quickly go viral.
In 2018, Samoa's central bank ordered banks and money-transfer services to block transfers of money out of Samoa related to One Coin. Through two Samoan churches with branches in New Zealand and Australia and the churches' leaders, the scam continued via Samoans in New Zealand, the central bank has said.
Tapu Tualemafua, a former government official who now runs a small business, said he handed over 1,000 tala ($360) in 2018 to an acquaintance who was collecting money for investment in One Coin.
The get-rich-quick scheme produced no return for Tapu and his 1,000 tala disappeared.
Despite that experience, he said the rapid way cryptocurrency can increase in value makes it appealing. He said he'd consider putting more money into digital currencies if they were under government supervision.
Ceremony in China celebrated first China-Samoa flight
The first of the flights from Haikou in Hainan province was celebrated with a ceremony in China attended by Zhu Hua, Chen Gen, three of Samoa's cabinet ministers and representatives of United Front and allied organizations, according to photos and a press release from the event published on several Chinese websites.
However, the timing and weekly frequency of the flights appears to have been sprung on Samoa earlier on. It caused concerns and a request for postponement, according to Travel Focus's own statement in the aftermath-which described Laauli as providing the vision for the venture-and Pativaine Reita Petaia-Tevita, the chief executive of Samoa Tourism Authority.
Before the pandemic, Samoa had almost 180,000 foreign tourists a year. Still recovering from the closure of its borders and with its high-season underway, the country did not have enough suitable accommodation to absorb a weekly flight from China.
When Travel Focus didn't take the advice provided, three times, we understood that they had already put in place these flights and it would have cost them and the passengers a lot of money if they were to cancel, Pativaine told BenarNews.
Travel Focus director Lincoln Linn said it continued to promote tours to Samoa and was still working closely with Samoa tourism authority and local land operators in Samoa. Its agency agreement with the Samoa Tourism Authority ended at the end of June and another company was selected as the agent for China.
He didn't respond to questions about Travel Focus's connections to Zhu and Jack Chen.
The Samoa Tourism Authority's offices in the main government building in the capital Apia are barebones but exude friendliness.
A sight-impaired man works on the reception and fa'afafine - transgender women in Samoa - are key members of the organization.
Sitting in front of a large map of Samoa's two main islands, Pativaine said it's been her aim to make the authority a positive place to work and a provider of opportunities.
She said she hopes a caring and sustainable approach will also guide how Samoa develops its tourism industry under a policy the authority is developing for cabinet consideration. Work on the tourism policy had been interrupted by the pandemic.
Tourism can benefit Samoa but it also imposes costs, she said, by creating competition for resources, damaging the environment and rubbing up against traditional culture.
The Samoan people will have to discuss this and decide what type of tourism they would like to have for Samoa, Pativaine said.
Once that's decided then everything else, all the plans will have to follow the policy, she said.
And if it means limiting the number of visitors from this market and this market and this market, then so be it.

Word Search: Ancient teas and their evolution
: Fancy a cup of tea? You’ll be spoilt for choice in today’s puzzle.
Click start to play the Word Search, where you’ll find a range of teas, from ‘chamomile’ to ‘ginger’.
Older than even the writing system and formal medicine, tea has graced homes and hearths for centuries. We learn a little more about the different kinds of tea mentioned in today’s puzzle, and how ancient history played a role in the way they’re consumed today:
1. Chamomile In ancient Egypt, chamomile was considered to be a gift from the deities. It was commonplace for people to offer the flower to the sun deity Ra. The body of Ramses II was anointed with it, and even King Tutankhamen’s sandals were decorated with the bloom. The ancient Greeks and Romans loved chamomile, as well, for its fruity aroma and its promise of calm. It was used medicinally in most cultures, by being crushed and made into tea, to treat skin conditions and other ailments. In modern times, it’s been studied as a remedy for anxiety disorder, because it is a natural sedative, possibly due to a compound in it, called apigenin.
2. Eucalyptus The oil from the eucalyptus tree is well known for its use as over-the-counter cough and cold products to relieve congestion; it’s also used for its refreshing and antiseptic properties. But the first people to use eucalyptus in tea form, were the aboriginal people of Australia – they did it to bring down fever. The plant was then introduced to the rest of the world in the 18th century, and it was quickly adopted by traditional Chinese and ayurveda medicine. Its leaves have a refreshing, minty taste, so teas made from eucalyptus offer an invigorating boost. Many cultures also pair this tea with echinacea, when they want to improve their immunity.
3. Chrysanthemum As a vital part of traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years, chrysanthemum is no stranger to Asia. It was first cultivated in China in the 15th century BC, and was considered a symbol of nobility and integrity. During the Song dynasty, it was brewed as a herbal tea and popularised, and then used for centuries to treat respiratory issues, blood pressure irregularities and as a calming, soothing beverage. In places like Korea, Singapore, and Japan, chrysanthemum tea is still consumed frequently, even in the summer, when it’s made into a cool, refreshing drink.

4. Besides incorporating nature into the mall's design, I am delighted to learn that sustainability is a key focus in the design and operations of The Woodleigh Mall.
5. Various sustainability efforts have been incorporated into the mall's design and operations. Some of them include using Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC) certified green concrete, ceiling boards and materials for construction, and active monitoring of water use and leak detection. Energy-efficient light fittings with sleep-mode features have also been adopted.
6. In addition, the mall has made it easier for residents to embrace a green lifestyle by providing 400 bicycle parking lots and handy end-of-trip facilities like lockers and showers. These facilities will encourage more residents to opt for cycling over driving to the mall.
7. In recognition of these sustainability efforts, Woodleigh Mall has been awarded the prestigious Building and Construction Authority (BCA) Green Mark Platinum Award. This award is the highest recognition in BCA's assessment for sustainable design, best practices and operations. I applaud the management and developers for their dedication and congratulate them on getting this well-deserved accolade.
8. By embracing green initiatives, we are creating a better future for our community and setting an example for others to follow.
Attractive retail offerings and services
9. The Woodleigh Mall not only champions sustainability but also offers a wide array of shopping, dining, and service retail options for visitors - from food and beverage (F&B) concepts to healthcare and educational services.
a. For instance, there is FairPrice Finest, a 24-hour supermarket with unique in-store concepts such as The Grocer Café offering freshly baked goods and brewed coffee.
b. You can also find MindSpace, an after-school care facility that provides a conducive environment to optimise children's learning experiences.
c. In addition, Parkway MediCentre is located in the mall, offering health screening, family medicine, specialist care, and traditional Chinese medicine services.
10. With such a wide range of options, I am sure visitors will enjoy and make full use of the facilities and services at The Woodleigh Mall.
Conclusion
11. Woodleigh Mall is well-positioned to become a hub for the Bidadari community and residents in the surrounding areas. I am confident this place will become an integral part of the Bidadari estate and its continued growth and development. Congratulations on the official opening of Woodleigh Mall, and kudos to all who have made this possible. I wish you every success in the years ahead. Have a great day, and happy shopping!

Anemic Auction in Asia Baffles Art Market
: Crow, Kelly. 
: China's collectors may not bail out the sinking art market this season.
Though global auction houses have depended on newly wealthy Chinese collectors to bid up trophy artworks no matter how the financial markets roiled, a disappointing Sotheby's Hong Kong sale of art amassed by one of China's powerhouse collecting couples suggests the tide could be turning.
Sotheby's $70 million sale on Thursday of 39 pieces from the holdings of Shanghai real-estate and pharmaceutical billionaire Liu Yiqian and his wife, Wang Wei, fell far short of the house's $94.4 million expectation.
An Amedeo Modigliani portrait of "Paulette Jourdain" that the couple bought for $42.8 million eight years ago only fetched $34.8 million this time.
Ten works, including examples by museum mainstays David Hockney, Stanley Whitney and Zao Wou-ki, failed to find buyers at all.
A further dozen offerings sold for below their asking prices, with works by star artists Mark Bradford and Javier Calleja selling to buyers who won after placing a single bid.
"It gives people pause as to how active Chinese bidders will be in New York later this fall," said Michael Plummer, an art finance adviser with New York firm Artvest. "We were already worried heading into this sale, and this underscores it."
China's rising class of entrepreneurial billionaires have become internationally known for plying their newfound fortunes into fine art. Liu, chairman of investment entity Sunline Group, is a former Shanghai taxi driver who rose to fame in the early 1990s by investing early and heavily in Chinese stocks, real-estate and pharmaceutical companies. He also started buying traditional Chinese objects, mostly at auctions.
In 2014, he caused an international stir when he used a credit card to pay Sotheby's Hong Kong $36.3 million for a Ming dynasty porcelain cup festooned with chickens on it. A photo of him subsequently sipping tea from the imperial cup went viral.
"I just wanted to see how it felt," he told The Wall Street Journal at the time.
His other major showstopper purchase: In 2015, he paid Christie's $170.4 million for another Modigliani, "Reclining Nude." Liu's wife, Wang, a longtime admirer of Chinese revolutionary art, urged him to add modern and contemporary artworks from the Western canon to their holdings.
Today, they are best known in art circles for displaying their traditional Asian art alongside international art stars at their private Long Museum, which they founded in 2012 and now maintain in both Shanghai and Chongqing, with Wang serving as director.
Nicolas Chow, worldwide head of Asian art and chairman of Sotheby's Asia, said the sale on Thursday included a mix of Chinese and Western modern and contemporary pieces from their personal trove, not the museum's. Chow said the couple intend to keep their museum open and funnel an undisclosed portion of the sale's proceeds into further acquisitions.
Chow added that the pieces they put up for sale on Thursday represent "less than 1% of their holdings," he said, speaking on the couple's behalf.
Even though their $170.4 million Modigliani wasn't up for bid, the back story behind that one purchase is emblematic of the crackling and bolstering role that China's billionaires have come to play on the international art stage.
In that Christie's sale, little consequence was ultimately given to the 10 offerings that failed to find buyers, including a Lucian Freud portrait that had been expected to sell for at least $20 million, and a Willem de Kooning "Woman" that was priced to sell for at least $14 million.
After the sale, the art world dwelled on the seven-minute duel over the Modigliani, which had been expected to sell for $100 million. It sold for far more, thanks to Liu and Wang's largess and rival underbidding by a young Korean dealer, Hong Gyu Shin.
Now, it's unclear how major evening sales will perform this fall if Chinese buyers don't join in at the top like usual. Between 2018 and 2022, Sotheby's said nearly a third of the collectors who placed $1 million-plus bids on its works hailed from Asia. This year alone, the house said Asians bid on half of its top-10 modern and contemporary artworks. Many of those buyers also hail from Taiwan, Singapore and Japan, said Alex Branczik, chairman of modern and contemporary art at Sotheby's Asia.
Branczik said it is too soon to count Chinese buyers out. In June, Chinese buyers were still reliably winning several of the priciest offerings during London's summer series, including a Hong Kong buyer who paid Sotheby's $108.4 million for Gustav Klimt's 1917-18 "Lady With a Fan," over its $80 million estimate. That purchase reset the record for any artwork auctioned in Europe.
Yet the fact that one of China's highest-profile art couples chose to unload art this fall -- including some pieces they only bought a few years ago -- won't soothe market jitters, Plummer said, especially since so many pieces underperformed.
China's economy is still besieged by shrinking exports and a troubled real-estate sector. Recently, the World Bank cut its 2024 forecast for China's gross domestic product growth to 4.4% from 4.8%. Economic growth across East Asia and the Pacific region is slowing faster than anticipated, the bank said in a report.
Thursday's auction follows anemic sales this spring and mixed results during a weeklong series of Asian art sales held in New York last month. During so-called Asia Week, which takes place annually in September, Sotheby's sold 87% of the lots in its $2.2 million Chinese ceramics and furniture sale on Sept. 26, yet it sold only 68% of the Tibetan antiquities and 39% of the Korean ceramics it offered in the same series.
Overall, it sold $30.4 million in Asian art, within its $23.4 million to $34.3 million presale expectation.
Christie's countering sales of Asian art in New York last month fared slightly better, with 78% of its $35 million offerings finding buyers. Yet when it came to the expected star of its week, "Marchant: Eight Treasures for the Wanli Emperor," only four managed to sell.
The next art-market gauge will be Oct. 11 when London's Frieze fair opens.

Are Chinese Buyers Bowing Out of the Art Market? A disappointing sale at Sotheby's Hong Kong suggests that China's art-buying spree may be over

India: G20 India Presidency - Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare, Dr Mansukh Mandaviya delivers keynote address at the concluding session of WHO Global Summit on Traditional Medicine in the presence of Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, Union Minister of AYUSH
: Integration of Traditional Medicine with modern medicine would contribute to advancing the health system attributes related to quality, efficiency, equity, accountability, sustainability and resilience. This was stated by Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, in the presence of Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, Union Minister of Ayush and Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, World Health Organization during his valedictory address at the G20 co-branded event, WHO Traditional Medicine Global Summit, co-hosted by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and the Ministry of Ayush. Shri Mahendra Munjapara, Union Minister of State for AYUSH and Dr Bharati Pravin Pawar and Prof. S P Singh Baghel, Union Ministers of State for Health and Family Welfare were also present.
The two - day Global Summit for Traditional Medicine, with the theme Towards Health and Well-being for All explored the role of traditional complimentary and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development.
Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Mandaviya said, Since the advent of a public health systems approach, there has always been a focus on providing holistic health services centred around the principles of healthcare integration. WHO's Global Conference on Primary Health Care, 2018 & Declaration of Astana on Primary Health care had also mentioned that the success of primary healthcare will be driven by applying scientific as well as traditional knowledge and by extending access to a range of healthcare services, which include traditional medicines.
On the different types of traditional medicinal practices that are followed in member states, such as Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese medicine, Herbal medicine etc, the Union Health Minister said, In India, under the leadership of the Hon'ble Prime Minister, we have a specific focus on Traditional Medicine & established a separate Ministry of AYUSH, which includes Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy.
He highlighted that during the COVID-19 crisis, traditional medicines had played a very important role through scientific and evidence-based medicines in terms of preventive, therapeutic and public health management. Ministry of Health and the Ministry of AYUSH works closely to integrate, endorse, and develop holistic health, including through availability of traditional medicines and yoga in 150,000+ Health & Wellness Centres and by establishing centres of integrated medicines in our tertiary hospitals, he stated.
Dr Mandaviya said, under the overarching theme of India's G20 Presidency of 'One Earth, One Family & One Future' and focus on reducing fragmentation and enhancing convergence, this meeting will be a torch bearer for effective health systems strengthening and will bring additional research, evidence and innovation to help us meet health-related Sustainable Development Goals.
Shri Sarbananda Sonowal said that the Ayush industry's evolution to holistic healthcare aligns with a global shift in health consciousness. This trend recognizes that health encompasses physical, mental, emotional and spiritual dimensions. He noted that the summit will help identify potential areas for collaboration and innovation in traditional medicines and help harness traditional medicine in achieving Universal Health Coverage goals.
Highlighting that the pandemic has underscored the significance of holistic health approaches, leading to a surge in interest and recognition for AYUSH systems, the Union AYUSH Minister said, the AYUSH systems of medicine like Ayurveda emphasizes equally on prevention and treatment parts of healthcare. Practices like yoga helps in mind and body healing.
Shri Sonowal also emphasized on the versatility of AYUSH across different industries. He said, the pharmaceutical and food processing sectors benefit from the demand for herbal remedies and natural products, while the diagnostic sector gains from AYUSH's preventive focus. This synergy amplifies India's healthcare ecosystem, contributing to economic growth and healthcare sustainability.
Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, Traditional medicines never had this kind of attention from governments, even though they have been practiced since millennia. Many of the important treatments of conventional medicines have their origin in traditional medicines like treatment for small pox. He regretted that Traditional Medicinal practices are mostly stigmatized as unscientific but emphasized that they have their own utility as well. Recognizing the benefits in the use of traditional medicines, WHO recently established the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine in Jamnagar, Gujarat, he stated.
Dr. Ghebreyesus appreciated India's role in promoting the use of traditional medicines and hoped that this first-ever summit on traditional medicines will be a catalyst for bringing together modern science and traditional knowledge in making health systems better.
Shri Sudhansh Pant, Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare: Shri Rajesh Kotecha, Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH; Shri Lav Agarwal, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare; and Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director, South East Asia Region, also participated at the event. The event also witnessed the participation of scientists, practitioners of traditional medicine, health workers and members of the civil society organizations from all over the world across the two days.

Thailand: Over 1.4 tonnes of pangolin scales seized in Kalasin province
: Thai police seized about 1.4 tonnes of pangolin scales, worth about 50 million baht, from a truck in the north-eastern province of Kalasin on Wednesday, as it was heading for Mukdahan province to be smuggled through Laos and into China.
Pol Col Ariyaphol Sinsorn, deputy commander of the Natural Resources and Environment Crime Division, said that the seizure was the result of cooperation between the Thai police and the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
He said that Thai and US investigators had tracked the movements of the smugglers for some time before they decided to arrest the truck driver and his assistant.
The driver reportedly told the police that he was hired for 20,000 baht to drive the truck, containing 42 bags, to Mukdahan province, while his assistant was paid 7,000 baht.
Prasert Sornsathapornkul, director of the Wildlife and Plant Protection Division, estimated that over 4,000 pangolins had been slaughtered in order to get the estimated 1,400kg of scales.
Pangolin scales are parts of a protected wildlife species under Thai law and their trade and possession are banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES).
Pangolin scales are used in traditional Chinese medicine to help with ailments ranging from lactation difficulties to arthritis. The scales are typically dried and ground into a powder, which may be turned into pills.
Pangolins are the most trafficked mammals in the world. Their meat is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional Chinese medicine. - Thai PBS

Acupuncture restores the natural healing abilities of the body, says practitioner
: Are you suffering from common office illnesses? Do not fret. Acupuncture has got your back. When you feel discomfort or pain, do you address the root cause of the disease or do you address the symptoms? While both Eastern and Western medicine concern themselves with realigning the flow of energy within the body, they vary in terms of where the focal point is placed. The focal point in traditional Chinese medicine is treating the person as a whole instead of the symptoms alone. On the other hand, Western medicine places a high emphasis on the treatment of symptoms through the prescription of a particular drug to address the pain. Acupuncture is a branch of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that deals with the insertion of needles in various points in the body in order to stimulate its ability to heal itself. (TCM and Ayurveda techniques make up Eastern medicine.) In some healthcare programs, intervention happens only when damage has been done. Vas Bismark, owner of Balanced Qi Health and Wellness Center, fills this gap by his proactive approach to healthcare. The certified acupuncturist sees his practice as a sustainable pain management program. 'Acupuncture is one of those modalities that specializes in treating and protecting illnesses. For example, in the office setting, common illnesses are rampant but people think they are normal. You have frozen shoulders, back pain, hyperacidity, headaches, migraines - these are things people deal with on a daily basis. They are symptoms of illnesses they don't have a direct answer to. Manage pain before it breaks out into something more serious. It is something I want to put a stop to by providing people with a sustainable pain management program,' Bismark explained. How can people benefit by putting acupuncture ahead of Western medicine to feel better and/or address their pain? 'When a person undergoes acupuncture, they are optimizing the efficiency of the circulation of their systems. Acupuncture helps bring a person's body function to its normal state-from your sleeping pattern, to your digestive, to your reproductive cycle [for women]. Acupuncture is designed to restore the natural healing abilities of the body,' he said. In this regard, one does not have to be sick or feel discomfort to enjoy the gains from acupuncture. When one is sick, acupuncture could make one feel better. It brings the body to a place where it could heal. On the other hand, when one is well, acupuncture helps reinforce the body against illnesses. It helps optimize its functions. In fact, Bismark has patients who visit him on a regular basis so that they could sleep better. They don't have anything wrong with them, they just want to feel relaxed. Aside from having acupuncture, one is also encouraged to sleep on time and to eat meals at scheduled times. 'Sleeping on time and regulating one's eating time go hand in hand. If you don't control your eating time it affects your sleeping time. Walk 6,000 steps a day. Give importance to consistency rather than intensity. As long as you are doing any form of exercise, be it 15 to 30 minutes a day, it is better than two to three hours of exercise once or twice a week,' he said.

China: Opening Remarks by Head of Chinese Mission to the African Union Ambassador Hu Changchun On the UN Chinese Language Day Celebration
: Mr. Antonio Pedro, Acting Executive Secretary of UNECA,
Your Excellencies Ambassadors,
Distinguished guests,
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
Good morning!
It gives me great pleasure to gather with you on the celebration of United Nations Chinese Language Day in 2023. First of all, I would like to thank the UNECA for initiating and co-hosting this event, and highly appreciate UNECA for promoting language equality and cultural diversity in international affairs. I would also like to thank the Confucius Institute and the Chinese Medical Team to Ethiopia for their strong support to this event.
Grain Rain is the 6th of the 24 solar terms, and the last solar term of spring. It embodies the beauty when spring turns to summer, and represents the growth of all things. It is said that on this day, Chinese characters were created by Cang Jie. Therefore, the UN chose Grain Rain as Chinese Language Day. Chinese is used by the largest population in the world and one of the six working languages of the UN. The use of Chinese language has since ensured the effective work of the UN, and has also promoted cultural and people-to-people exchanges between China and countries around the world.
Language is the carrier of human civilization. As one of the languages with the longest history, the most elegant structure and the deepest ideological connotation in the world, the Chinese language is attracting more and more global friends to explore and feel the essence of the profound Chinese culture behind it. China is actively engaged in cooperation with other countries, Confucius Institutes and Classrooms have been set up in 159 countries, among which more than 70 Confucius Institutes and Classrooms have been established in African countries. According to statistics, more than 30 million people are learning Chinese outside China, and the total number of foreign Chinese learners is close to 200 million. In Africa, 17 countries have included Chinese language in their education system, over 600 thousand African people are using or learning Chinese. The learning and use of Chinese serve as a bridge of mutual learning between civilizations, allowing more and more friends all around the world to feel the beauty of poetry in Tang and Song Dynasty, the profound philosophy of traditional Chinese medicine, the rapid development of China, and find the key to the success of Chinese path to modernization.
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
A single flower does not make spring, while one hundred flowers in full blossom bring spring to the garden. As the future of all countries are closely connected, tolerance, coexistence, exchanges and mutual learning among different civilizations play an irreplaceable role in advancing humanity's modernization process and making the garden of world civilizations flourish. Recently, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Civilization Initiative, which advocates the respect for the diversity of civilizations, the common values of humanity, the importance of inheritance and innovation of civilizations, and robust international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation. Both China and Africa have a long historical civilization as well as rich cultural and artistic resources. Various and colorful cultural exchange activities will surely enhance people-to-people bonds between China and Africa and lay a solid foundation for cooperation. We hope that more African friends could further experience Chinese traditional culture and understand Chinese path to modernization through this Chinese Language Day event. We are willing to work with all African friends to write a new chapter for the mutual learning of Chinese and African civilizations in the new era as well as the building of a China-Africa community with a shared future!
Finally, I wish this event a complete success!
Thank you.

Folk medical practice helps researchers find new drugs
: DAVAO CITY-Traditional, or folk medical practices, including their array of herbs and concoctions, have contributed vastly to the discovery of new drugs, including the current interest on a plant with vast anti-cancer potential, an international biotechnology service center said. 'Historical data shows that plant-based traditional medicines have helped modern researchers find leads for new drug discovery,' the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications(ISAAA) said in its recent weekly issue of the Biotech Update online publication released this week. This was the case of the recent interest of an international collaboration of researchers on the plant called skullcap (Scutellaria barbata), which has been the common plant used in Chinese traditional medicine to treat indications similar to cancer symptoms. In a February 15 writeup of Biotech Update, it said skullcap's microevolutionary history was the key to the dedicated research on the anti-cancer potential of the plant, and 'led to sequencing of skullcap plant's genome.' 'It helped identify how the plant produces a compound called scutebarbatine A that is known to act against a range of cancer cells,' the research said. Skullcap was more commonly known in China as banzhilian, it added. 'It is used for the treatment of different medical conditions in traditional Chinese medicine [TCM].' 'TCM practitioners would boil the plant for two hours and dry the extract to produce a powder that has its isolated medicinal chemistry. The powder is given to patients to be taken as a decoction,' it said. The Biotech Update story said 'previous clinical work showed that preparations based on the skullcap plant during chemotherapy could reduce the risk of metastatic tumors in patients.' The story said the international collaboration of researchers were fielded by the John Innes Centre and Chinese Academy of Scientists with support from The Royal Society. 'They were able to piece together the plant's genome sequence. They found that the primary metabolite has activity against cancer cells but not with cancer cells. This is vital for anti-cancer metabolites in drugs,' it said. The researchers said that the discovery could help develop a sustainable and quicker method to synthesize larger quantities of the anti-cancer compound using yeast, it added. The Biotech Update story said the anti-cancer drugs obtained from TCM 'have higher efficacy and less toxic side effects than chemical synthetic drugs.'

Historical launch of Pak herbal seeds into outer space praised
: The Advisory Panel on Traditional Medicine Member and WHO Chief Scientist Prof. Dr. Liu Xinmin on Tuesday emphasized the importance of the "Chinese-Pakistan Cooperation on Medicinal Plants", and said that the launch of Pakistani herbal seeds into outer space in June 2022 was a historical event, says a Press release. The hybrid seeds, prepared at the International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), University of Karachi, for short trips to space will help scientists to develop new varieties, he said, adding that these varieties can help feed the world's growing population, in the changing climate, and also treat incurable diseases. He was talking to a group of scientists at the ICCBS, University of Karachi, before his departure to China. Prof. Dr. M. Iqbal Choudhary, Director of the International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences, and COMSTECH Coordinator General, thanked the famous Chinese scientists for his visit to ICCBS, University of Karachi. It is pertinent to mention here that China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) had launched Pakistani herbal seeds into outer space in June 2022 and, after six months flying, returned them safely to the earth in December. Prof. Liu Xinmin pointed out that China and Pakistan have a long history of traditional medicines. Traditional Chinese Medicines (TMC) is practiced in China, while Pakistani owned a long history of Traditional Unani Medicine (TUM) to practice against the common ailments. He said that the prospects of Chinese-Pakistan Cooperation were massive. The cooperation in Science and Technology is a significant fragment of the China-Pakistan bilateral relations.

Western Covid Medicine to China's Rescue; As zero-Covid ends, Chinese want foreign vaccines and antivirals.
: One conceit of Chinese leader Xi Jinping is that the West is in terminal decline and the Communist Party is destined to dominate the world in technology and politics. So don't expect the Party media to celebrate the country's emergency acceptance of Western Covid medicine.
Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Co. said Tuesday that Chinese users of its health app can now sign up to get doses of the Western-made BioNTech mRNA vaccine in Hong Kong. That's happy news for affluent Chinese passport holders who can hop a flight to Hong Kong or nearby Macau, where vaccine tourism has been booming since Mainland infections began to rise.
Less lucky are the hundreds of millions of Chinese who don't have a passport, much less the means to jet off for a weekend jab. What would Mao Zedong say about this lack of equality, Comrade Xi?
For nearly three years China has refused to accept Western mRNA shots while favoring Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines. But that nationalist strategy has lost credibility as zero-Covid ends and infection spreads in China. A December review of Singapore health data in the Lancet found that people over age 60 who received three doses of a traditional vaccine (like those made in China) had higher incidence of severe Covid and Covid hospitalization than those who took the mRNA vaccines.
Hong Kong has obediently adjusted its vaccination policies to absorb the moneyed Mainland masses, but vaccination tourism won't be enough to prevent the contagion inflicting preventable deaths on the Mainland. The sudden reversal of Covid mandates in an aging population with limited natural immunity is feeding a wave of infection that needs treatment as much as prevention.
Here too the Western medical cavalry has arrived with Pfizer's Paxlovid, the antiviral that moderates symptoms for most patients. China approved the drug for emergency use in February, but demand is now outpacing supply.
Lines have been stretching outside fever clinics and community health centers in major Chinese cities. In mid-December, Reuters reported that a Chinese health app offering Paxlovid sold out in half an hour. The South China Morning Post says Mainland demand for antiviral drugs is so high that many Chinese are now scooping up Indian generic versions that may be less effective.
China denied its citizens the best vaccines and therapies because it didn't want to admit the inferiority of its medical science and biotechnology industry. Pfizer and Moderna were offering to sell their vaccines to Beijing, but the Party demanded that the companies turn over their intellectual property. Mr. Xi may also have figured China could steal it.
Beijing had nearly three years to prepare for the inevitable end of zero-Covid, and it could have done so by buying Western vaccines, antivirals and even basic fever medicines that are also now in short supply in China. This month's Chinese protests questioned President Xi's zero-Covid lockdowns. The next protest should question why so many Chinese are needlessly dying because the Party followed Mr. Xi's blinkered nationalism.

How a new functional medicine and wellness concept helps people live longer and happier
: Reach by. 
: The UAE's first integrative medicine hub, Wellth, endorsed by international wellness gurus Deepak Chopra and Frank Lipman, opened its doors earlier this month. Aptly named to signify true wealth, which is health and wellness, Wellth combines western medicine with time-tested healing therapies from the East to provide the best possible outcomes for patients.
With the help of a range of alternative therapies - some of them curated by Chopra and Lipman who are globally renowned for their integrative approach - the new hub offers functional medicine that treats patients holistically. In this patient-centric model, functional medicine experts use 360-degree medical and wellness knowledge to find the root cause of the disease and manage them with customised care plans.
"Functional medicine doctors don't just treat the disease, but look at the body as a whole to find the trigger point for health imbalances," explains Dr Khalid Shukri, a Wellth Specialist and American Board-certified physician in anti-ageing and regenerative medicine and fellow of functional and metabolic health of the American Academy of Anti-Ageing Medicine. "This is especially helpful for chronic conditions such as diabetes, rheumatic disorders and cardiac disease, as they are mostly multi-system diseases.
"For example, if someone experiences constant acidity, fatigue, stomach aches and sleeping difficulty, then they might visit four different specialists and get prescribed four different medications. However, a functional medicine expert will look at this patient and try to find the reason why all these symptoms are occurring."
Through detailed investigations, the functional medicine expert will find the real cause of all the symptoms and treat it with an integrative approach involving alternative therapies, nutrition, stress management, supplements, lifestyle changes, and more.
To aid in this integrative approach, Wellth, managed by Medcare, has experts in traditional alternative therapies such as Ayurveda, Chinese medicine, homeopathy, reiki and yoga as well as movement therapies like chiropractic, osteopathy and physiotherapy.
While Ayurveda, Chinese medicine and homoeopathy stimulate the body's ability to self-heal to improve immunity as well as provide pain relief and energy boost, complementary medicines such as chiropractic and osteopathy manipulate the musculoskeletal structure to reduce pain and improve sleep and overall functioning of the body.
However, Wellth's focus is not limited to managing diseases. It takes a holistic mind-body-spirit approach to offer patients emotional and physical wellbeing through preventive medicine and anti-ageing therapies.
"Anti-ageing and cell regeneration treatments improve the quality of life of the cells by extending the health of the cells and repairing damaged tissue," says Dr Shukri, who has extensive experience in the field. "Cell regeneration will maintain the body in a healthy state, delaying or removing the onset of diseases while allowing the body to function at optimal energy levels leading to longer happier lives. The health benefits of these treatments are vast and the effort is minimal."
Common therapies at Wellth with anti-ageing and cell regeneration properties
Cryotherapy or cold cure, uses cold as a treatment method for damaged cells. Research has shown that unlike chronic stress, which is bad for overall health, short boosts of temperature stress are actually beneficial for the immune system and cell regeneration. What cryotherapy does is provide that small boost of temperature stress to the body by exposing it to an extreme change in temperature for a short period of time. This is a highly effective method for anti-ageing and cell regeneration.
Infrared is a painless and minimally invasive treatment that exposes the body to infrared light, which improves tissue quality, elasticity and collagen boost that regenerates cells in the body.
Ayurveda is a curative and preventive practice that creates harmony between body, mind and soul through powerful plant-based therapies. They prevent ageing disorders from taking a toll on your health.
Acupuncture stems from Chinese medicine and is based on improving the flow of energy or life through the body. It involves the insertion of very thin needles at strategic points on your body. Increasingly, it is being used for overall wellness, including stress management.
Trichology lessens, reverses and stops the greying of hair by targeting the root cause of grey hair at a cellular level.
Nutrition therapy uses food rich in antioxidants and vitamins to promote cellular anti-ageing and get rid of free radicals in the body.
Oxygen therapy stimulates collagen and elastin production in the skin, the lack of which is responsible for the ageing of the skin. It benefits the functions of other organs in the body as well.
Vitamin IV detox is designed specifically for anti-ageing. Based on patients' vitamin and mineral imbalances that are diagnosed through the use of an Oligoscan, a special IV mixture is created and injected through a drip.
Facial lymphatic drainage helps depuff the face and body, while stimulating the growth of collagen and elastin in the skin.

Welcome to the social wellness club: Trend | Remedy Place's new Manhattan outpost is drawing well-heeled, healthminded clients who prefer ice baths to happy hours. Hannah Marriott dives in
: Marriott, Hannah. 
: I 've never been to a member's club quite like Remedy Place, which opened last month in Manhattan's Flatiron neighbourhood. It is a greige cocoon of taupe carpets and putty-coloured daybeds, with every inch of its 7,200 square feet engineered for health optimisation. The sound system emits both lounge music and inaudible frequencies designed to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, a network of nerves that relaxes the body. Palo santo and sage are diffused throughout the building in an hourly "aromatic design ritual". The bar, billed as "Toxin and Tempt- ation Free", sells snacks and drinks infused with ingredients that promise to make you feel better, not worse, from nootropic seltzers to trail mix with adaptogens (natural substances such as ginger and reishi mushrooms, which herbalists use to combat stress). So far, so peak wellness. But it is beyond the bar, in the bowels of the twostorey building, that things get really interesting. There are IV bags glistening on hooks next to a succession of sleek, mushroom-coloured daybeds. There are lymphatic drainage suits, which look like futuristic sleeping bags, lying dormant in treatment rooms. There is a pair of glass-hatched hyperbaric chambers, which await their passengers like escape shuttles in a sci-fi movie. And every now and then I see a swirl of dry ice from beneath a curtain, in some far off corner, meaning that someone, somewhere, has opened the door to a cryotherapy chamber. The first branch of Remedy Place, which 32-year-old founder Jonathan Leary describes as "the world's first social wellness club", opened in 2019 in Los Angeles, and was a hit with sports stars and celebrities including the Kardashians. It recently raised $5mn from an eclectic list of private investors including Russian-German DJ Zedd, Australian electro band Rüfüs Du Sol and NFL player Marcedes Lewis. The Remedy Place concept pairs wellbeing with "human connection". The idea is to go there for date night, or a corporate event, while dunking in a dopamine-boosting ice bath, rather than while imbibing booze and sugar. All the treatments, says Leary, are designed to put the body "in a better state to do what it does best". Although this may sound like a repackaging of existing concepts, Leary says Remedy is not a spa, because it does not address beauty or relaxation: the focus is on high-tech, holistic and traditional Chinese medicine treatments. Leary, who holds a doctorate from Southern California University of Health Sciences in Chiropractic Medicine and Alternative Medicine and recently had Remedy tattooed on the back of his hand, truly believes he is at the vanguard of a new era. "Self-care is going to be the new fitness industry; you're going to see self-care, recovery, preventive care places on every corner," he says. His investors have told him "if you execute the right way, this could be a billion-dollar company." Whether or not world domination comes to fruition, it's clear that Remedy Place has been precision-engineered to chime with this particular cultural moment. Despite global economic uncertainty, wellness is booming, according to McKinsey, which estimates the category's global worth as at least $1.5tn and forecasts near-term growth of 5 to 10 per cent annually. Wellness includes, but is not limited to, fitness, sleep, nutrition, alternative medicine, mindfulness and beauty treatments. None are new considerations but myriad factors have collided to make such concerns freshly profitable, including increased openness about mental health, rising knowledge about sleep issues, and a shift in the "boundary between 'consumer' and 'healthcare'", says McKinsey partner Anna Pione. Covid has accelerated interest: "It's made a lot of people just very conscious of their health and their mortality," she says. For all its potential, wellness is also controversial. Companies such as Goop — perhaps the world's most famous wellness empire — have frequently faced accusations of false promises. In 2018 Goop paid $145,000 to settle a lawsuit over health claims pertaining to essential oils, and jade and quartz vaginal eggs (the company admitted no wrongdoing). The science is certainly complicated. Most of Remedy Place's treatments — infrared saunas, cryotherapy, cold water immersion, acupuncture — have only limited, if promising, studies behind them, and only the lymphatic massage suit, BallancerPro, is FDA cleared. Though there are limited studies showing Vitamin C IVs' effectiveness in reducing fatigue and inflammation, the research behind IV drips is not robust and many medical experts would discourage their use in otherwise healthy patients. And there are no studies I could find that confirm any of these treatments' use for hangovers — though this is something many clients come in seeking relief for. (One tells me he swears by a multivitamin IV drip and an infrared sauna as his Sunday morning cure-all.) Still, Leary stands behind everything he offers and says he is his own best case study. He uses all of the treatments including NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) injections, which he self-administers five days a week and calls "a fountain of youth". "Everything is in the club because I have used it with my patients for over seven years," he says, adding that he hopes to use the business as a foundation to fund studies into alternative medicine. Such debates will probably be familiar to Remedy Place clients. They are likely to fall into a customer segment McKinsey calls the "wellness enthusiast": big earners who make up 13 per cent of the population but are responsible for 25 per cent of spending within the category. The clients I spoke to seemed to fit this template. Matthew McFate, a 27-year-old actor/singer/writer/producer based in LA, visited because he had been researching Ear Seeds (a traditional Chinese medicine treatment using pressure points on the ears) and wanted to try it. Another, Nic, who pays $595 for monthly membership in Manhattan, was attracted to Remedy Place for cryotherapy, which he has done regularly since his days as a college athlete. Another big draw, he says, is having a place to work, with some health benefits and structure, after two years of working from home. "New York apartments are not big — it doesn't matter how much money you have — and that's not ideal for mental clarity." The day I visited the club the place skewed young and male. The price (from $595 to $2,750 a month, although non-members can visit for ad hoc treatments) is of course self-selecting, as is the Flatiron location, home to many tech and finance start-ups. Everyone I saw at the club seemed well-heeled and a bit giddy, from the therapist who told me working there had changed her life, to the two fiftysomething men who emerged glowing from the ice bath class and told me I had to do it. That afternoon my two sisters-in-law arrived to try the ice bath class with me. It was pretty simple: 10 minutes of deep breathing on a yoga mat, followed by a very cold, mind-over-matter sixminute dip in frigid water, then wrapping up, with chattering teeth, in a towel, and sharing a cup of tea and a sense of achievement. For the next 48 hours I kept asking myself: do I feel different? Is that dopamine, spiking? Do I have a bit more energy? I honestly have no idea. I'm not in the right demographic to pay $2,000 a month for membership, nor the $50 à la carte ice breath class, but I see the appeal. It was just as bonding as a night out, and without a hangover afterwards. 'Self-care is going to be the new fitness industry. You're going to see self-care places on every corner' CREDIT: Hannah Marriott

China: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian's Regular Press Conference on April 8, 2022
: CRI: According to reports, Yemeni President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi announced in a televised statement on April 7 that he would transfer power to a newly-formed presidential leadership council. Does China have any comment?
Zhao Lijian: China welcomes the formation of the presidential leadership council in Yemen. We support relevant Yemeni parties in realizing a political settlement of the Yemeni issue through dialogue. We commend the effort by the Gulf Cooperation Council and other parties to promote political consultation in Yemen, which has produced positive outcomes. We hope that all sides in Yemen will take this as an opportunity to continue to advance the political resolution process so as to restore security and stability at an early date.
AFP: Do you have any more information on today's virtual meeting between President Xi and President Duterte of the Philippines?
Zhao Lijian: We will release information in due course if there's any.
Dragon TV: The website of the WHO released the report on WHO Expert Meeting on Evaluation of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of COVID-19 the other day. The report recognizes the safety and efficacy of TCM in treating patients with COVID-19, and encourages Member States to consider the integration of TCM in planning for the clinical management of COVID-19 in the context of their health-care systems and regulatory frameworks. What is China's comment?
Zhao Lijian: I have noted the report. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, TCM has been deeply and comprehensively involved in the pandemic prevention and control in China. Applying TCM and integrating TCM and Western medicine have delivered notable effects. As the WTO report pointed out, TCM was seen to reduce the risk of mild or moderate disease progressing to severe disease. For mild-to-moderate cases, the studied TCMs, when administered as add-on interventions to conventional treatment, may shorten the time for viral clearance, resolution of clinical symptoms and length of hospital stay when compared to conventional treatment alone. And early application of TCM may result in better clinical outcomes for patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.
Traditional Chinese medicine is a gem of the Chinese nation and treasure for people around the world. Since COVID-19 broke out, China has been making contributions to the global fight against the pandemic with TCM. According to incomplete statistics, China has so far shared TCM diagnosis and treatment guidelines with over 150 countries and regions, provided TCM products to more than 10 countries and regions in need, and sent TCM experts to guide epidemic control in 29 countries and regions. In March last year, the Chinese side held the Forum on Traditional Chinese Medicine and International Cooperation to Fight Against COVID-19 Pandemic, during which political leaders, government officials, WHO representatives and experts from 28 countries and regions had in-depth exchanges via videolink. The forum adopted the Initiative on Supporting the Application of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Global Fight Against COVID-19. Not long ago, the Chinese side released a development plan to enhance the integration of TCM into high quality Belt and Road cooperation for the period from 2021 to 2025. It proposes that during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, China will cooperate with countries along the Belt and Road to build 30 high-quality TCM centers overseas to provide quality TCM services to people of these countries.
China has been doing its utmost in the fight against COVID-19 together with the rest of the world. China has been sharing its experience in applying TCM to prevention, control and treatment with the rest of the world with nothing held back. We are glad to see that more and more countries have come to appreciate the value of TCM. The WHO Expert Meeting's explicit acknowledgement of TCM's role in combating COVID-19 is an epitome of this increasing international recognition. China stands ready to work with other countries as well as the WHO to give full play to the unique advantages and role of traditional medicine including TCM, deepen exchange and cooperation in traditional medicine, continue to advance international cooperation in epidemic prevention and control, and contribute to protecting the life and health of people in all countries.
Macau Monthly: Recorded Future, a US-based cybersecurity consultancy, said in its report that hackers suspected to be linked to the Chinese government launched activities of cyber espionage against India's power sector near Ladakh for recent months. The company has passed on the information to the Indian government. Union Minister for Power and New and Renewable Energy Shri R. K. Singh confirmed cyber attacks on India. Do you have any comment?
Zhao Lijian: China has noted the relevant report. Based on some footage of media interviews, the Indian official mainly talked about the importance for the country to take measures to strengthen its cybersecurity. They did not associate cyber activities with China, and said they could originate from any country. It is China's consistent belief that cybersecurity is a common challenge facing all countries that should be jointly addressed through dialogue and cooperation.
For some time, in the name of enhancing capacity building, the US has been seeking military cooperation with China's neighbors in the field of cyberspace to pursue Forward Deployment in China's neighborhood. We have also noted that the US government and some cyber security companies have started to spread disinformation about Chinese hacking in a systematic manner. China is firmly opposed to this.
Recently, Chinese cyber security companies released a series of reports, revealing that the US government launched cyber attacks on many countries around the world, including China, seriously jeopardizing the security of critical infrastructure of these countries. It is worth noting that many of US allies or countries with which it cooperates on cyber security are also victims of US cyber attacks. We believe that the international community, especially China's neighboring countries, will keep their eyes wide open and make their own judgment on the true intentions of the US side.
Bloomberg: So it appears Nancy Pelosi isn't going to make a trip to Taiwan after all, because she has COVID. Do you have a comment about this?
Zhao Lijian: China has recently made its position clear on Speaker Pelosi's planned visit to Taiwan and Chinese officials have also lodged solemn representations with the US side. We extend sympathy to Speaker Pelosi for contracting COVID-19 and wish her a speedy recovery. What she should do is not postpone the visit, but cancel it immediately.
RIA Novosti: On Thursday, the United Nations General Assembly suspended Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. What's China's comment on that?
Zhao Lijian: China's Permanent Representative to the UN already fully expounded China's position in his statement before the vote of the General Assembly. I would like to reiterate that China always stands for promoting and protecting human rights through constructive dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect. China firmly opposes the politicization and instrumentalization of the human rights issue, rejects selective and confrontational approaches as well as double standards on human rights issue, and opposes pressuring other countries in the name of human rights. The resolution would strip Russia of its legal membership in the Human Rights Council. Such a serious matter must be handled with extreme caution and in a calm, objective and rational approach based on facts and truth. The relevant resolution was not drafted in an open and transparent manner, nor did it follow the tradition of holding consultations within the whole membership to heed the broadest opinions. Such a move will only aggravate the division among member states and intensify the contradictions between the parties concerned. It is like adding fuel to the fire, which is not conducive to the de-escalation of conflicts, and even less so to advancing the peace talks. Dealing with the membership of the Human Rights Council in such a way would set a new and dangerous precedent, further intensify confrontations, bring a greater impact on the UN governance system, and produce serious consequences. China calls on all parties to work together in the same direction, so as to create opportunities for peace and prospects for negotiation.
The Paper: The Guardian reported that according to a newly declassified report, a detainee at a secret CIA detention site in Afghanistan was used as a living prop to teach trainee interrogators, who lined up to take turns at knocking his head against a plywood wall and douse him with ice-cold water. The tortures against humanity have left him devastated both physically and mentally. Do you have any comment?
Zhao Lijian: The CIA has set up black sites in many countries under the pretext of War on Terror, where the terrorist suspects they alleged have been secretly put under arbitrary detention and extortion of confessions by torture is applied. This has drawn widespread criticism from the international community. The notorious Guantanamo Bay, the Bagram prison in Afghanistan and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, are caught up in prisoner abuse scandals, with the use of brutal and horrifying enhanced interrogation techniques including waterboarding and sleep deprivation.
These black sites are typical examples of the US' trampling on the rule of law and violation of human rights. The report of the Costs of War Project of the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University at the beginning of this year points out that following the attacks of September 11, the US has orchestrated a system of black sites throughout the world in at least 54 countries and regions, where over 100,000 people were detained, and the detainees include Muslims, females and children. US taxpayers are spending $540 million a year just to detain prisoners at Guantánamo.
However, not a single US official has so far been held to account for devising, authorizing or implementing the secret detention and torture program. The US government has even gone further to cover up and deny its crimes and violations of human rights. In 2020, after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) noted that the US forces and CIA may have committed war crimes with prisoner abuse in Afghanistan, the US leveled sanctions and imposed visa restrictions on several officials, including the chief prosecutor of the ICC. In 2021, after the UN Committee Against Torture said that the CIA black sites are rife with torture, the US government refused to disclose relevant information citing confidentiality.
Facts speak louder than words. The US black sites around the world fully indicate that the US has no right to point fingers at others in the name of democracy and human rights. What the US should do is immediately abolish its black sites all over the world, earnestly reflect on its crimes, apologize to and compensate for the victims, and hold those who authorized and carried out torture accountable.

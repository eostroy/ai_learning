China Traditional Chinese Medicine Shares Surge on $2 Billion Takeover Offer; State-owned pharmaceuticals giant Sinopharm, which owns 32% of China TCM, made a cash offer to buy shares
Qu, Tracy.
China Traditional Chinese Medicine's shares posted their biggest intraday percentage gain in over 15 years after its controlling shareholder offered to privatize the company for 15.65 billion Hong Kong dollars ($2.00 billion).
The shares of the company, also called China TCM, was last 23% higher in Hong Kong after rising as much as 26% earlier to touch a high of HK$4.32.
State-owned pharmaceuticals giant Sinopharm, which owns 32% of China TCM, made a cash offer to buy the remaining shares for HK$4.6 each after the market closed Wednesday, a 34% premium over its close at HK$3.43 on Feb. 8.
The stock hadn't traded since then because of the Lunar New Year holidays and a halt in trading earlier this week.
Sinopharm said that it doesn't plan to raise its offer price for China TCM.
The company has over 18,000 employees and is headquartered in Foshan, Guangdong.
Its products cover several fields including China-patented medications, herbs, herbal granules and chemical-based medicines.
"The offer is fair in the context of the previous rumored privatization prices," Arun George of Global Equity Research, who publishes on Smartkarma, said in a note.
China TCM's second-largest shareholder, Ping An Insurance, owns 12% of China TCM's outstanding shares and has a blocking stake but would be receptive to the offer, he said.

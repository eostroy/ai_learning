In summary, the sentence primarily expresses a **'judgment'** about the practice of TCM, suggesting a need for change based on ethical or practical considerations.

Sentence: While the impact of the illegal ivory trade on elephants has been well documented, rhinos are another highly endangered species, with only about 25,000 rhinos left in the wild.
Analysis: The sentence primarily expresses **'judgment'** according to Martin's Appraisal Theory.

### Explanation:
- **'Affect'** refers to the expression of emotions or feelings. The sentence does not convey any emotional response or personal feeling about the situation.
- **'Appreciation'** involves evaluating the value or worth of something, often in terms of aesthetics, ethics, or social significance. While the sentence does discuss the endangered status of rhinos, it does not explicitly evaluate their value or worth in a broader context.
- **'Judgment'** involves making moral or social evaluations of people, behaviors, or situations. In this sentence, the focus is on the endangered status of rhinos, which is a social and moral evaluation. The phrase "highly endangered species" implies a judgment about the severity of the situation and the need for concern or action.

Therefore, the sentence primarily expresses **'judgment'** by evaluating the social and moral significance of the rhinos' endangered status.

- **Affect**: This category would involve the expression of emotions or feelings. While the sentence does evoke a sense of concern or sadness about the situation, it does not explicitly express the speaker's emotional state. Instead, it focuses on the factual reporting of the event, which aligns more with 'judgment' than 'affect'.

- **Appreciation**: This category involves the evaluation of things, processes, or situations in terms of their value or worth. While the sentence does highlight the loss of rhinos, which could be seen as a loss of value in terms of biodiversity, the primary focus is on the judgment of the act of hunting and killing, rather than the appreciation of the rhinos themselves.

Therefore, the sentence primarily expresses 'judgment' due to its focus on the evaluation of the behavior (hunting and killing rhinos) in terms of its moral and ethical implications.

Sentence: "Scientists believe this number is an underestimate."

### Explanation:
- **Judgment**: This category in Appraisal Theory deals with the evaluation of behavior, particularly in terms of social propriety, normality, capacity, tenacity, and veracity. In this sentence, the speaker, Huang, is expressing a judgment about the **veracity** (truthfulness or accuracy) of a claim. Specifically, Huang is questioning the truth of the claim that something (presumably a treatment or remedy) has "special curative effects." This is a judgment about the credibility or reliability of the information being discussed.

- **Affect**: This category is about the expression of emotions and feelings. While the sentence might imply some level of skepticism or doubt, it does not explicitly express emotions like anger, joy, or sadness. Therefore, 'affect' is not the primary focus here.

- **Appreciation**: This category involves the evaluation of cultural, aesthetic, or natural values. The sentence does not focus on the aesthetic quality, cultural significance, or natural value of something. Instead, it is concerned with the truthfulness of a claim, making 'appreciation' less relevant in this context.

In summary, the sentence primarily expresses a **judgment** about the veracity of a claim, rather than an emotional response ('affect') or an evaluation of cultural or aesthetic value ('appreciation').

### 1. **Affect:**
   - **Expression:** The sentence does not explicitly express emotions or feelings. It is a factual statement rather than an emotional one.
   - **Explanation:** Affect refers to the expression of emotions and feelings. Since the sentence does not convey any emotional response or personal feeling, it does not fit the category of 'affect'.

### 2. **Judgment:**
   - **Expression:** The sentence does not explicitly judge any behavior, character, or social esteem. It presents information without making moral or ethical evaluations.
   - **Explanation:** Judgment involves evaluating behavior, character, or social esteem. The sentence does not pass any judgment on the beliefs of "folks" or the efficacy of rhino horn and salicylic acid. It merely states a belief and a fact.

### 3. **Appreciation:**
   - **Expression:** The sentence can be seen as expressing appreciation in terms of evaluating the value or significance of the information presented.
   - **Explanation:** Appreciation involves evaluating the value, significance, or impact of something. In this sentence, the comparison between the belief in rhino horn and the scientific fact about salicylic acid can be seen as an evaluation of the validity and significance of these two pieces of information. The sentence implicitly appreciates the scientific knowledge (salicylic acid) over the folk belief (rhino horn), suggesting a higher value or credibility to the former.

### Conclusion:
The sentence primarily expresses **'appreciation'** as it evaluates the value and significance of the information presented, particularly in comparing a folk belief with scientific knowledge.

Analysis: The sentence provided can be analyzed according to Martin's Appraisal Theory as expressing 'judgment'. 

### Explanation:
- **Judgment**: The sentence expresses a moral evaluation or assessment of the actions described. Specifically, it judges the illegal trade in powdered rhino horn as "clever" and "disguising" its tracks. This judgment is not about emotions (affect) or aesthetic value (appreciation), but rather about the ethical or social evaluation of the actions of those involved in the illegal trade.
- **Involved Appraisal Resources**:
  - **"clever"**: This word carries a judgmental tone, suggesting a negative evaluation of the illegal traders' tactics. It implies that their methods are effective but morally questionable.
  - **"illegal"**: This term directly labels the trade as morally wrong, reinforcing the judgmental stance.
  - **"disguise"**: This word further emphasizes the deceptive nature of the trade, adding to the negative judgment.

Overall, the sentence reflects a moral judgment about the behavior of those involved in the illegal trade, critiquing their methods as clever but ethically dubious.

Sentence: "These professional poachers are well-trained and can cut off rhino horns within minutes," Huang said.
Analysis: The sentence "These professional poachers are well-trained and can cut off rhino horns within minutes," Huang said, can be analyzed according to Martin's Appraisal Theory as primarily expressing **'judgment'**.

### Explanation:

1. **'Affect'**: This category in Appraisal Theory deals with emotions and feelings. The sentence does not explicitly convey any emotional response or feeling from Huang or the speaker. It is more factual and descriptive rather than emotional.

2. **'Judgment'**: This category involves making moral or social assessments of people's behavior. In this sentence, the term "professional poachers" implies a negative judgment about the poachers' actions. The phrase "well-trained" suggests a level of skill and efficiency, but it is used in a context that is morally condemnable (poaching). The ability to "cut off rhino horns within minutes" further emphasizes the efficiency and effectiveness of their actions, which is a negative judgment in the context of illegal and harmful activities.

3. **'Appreciation'**: This category is about evaluating the value of things, including natural, social, and cultural phenomena. The sentence does not focus on evaluating the value of objects or phenomena; instead, it evaluates the behavior of the poachers.

Sentence: "In South Africa, you can get up to six years for manslaughter, but up to 15 for killing a rhino, and yet the [poachers] aren't deterred ... because of the huge profits involved," he said.
Analysis: The sentence can be analyzed according to Martin's Appraisal Theory as expressing both 'judgment' and 'appreciation'.

### Judgment:

The mention of "killing a rhino" and "the huge profits involved" indicates an appreciation of the ecological and economic significance of rhino poaching. The speaker is highlighting the severity of the issue and the potential consequences, which can be seen as an appreciation of the broader context and implications of the situation.

In summary, the sentence expresses 'judgment' through the speaker's critical evaluation of the legal system and the poachers, and 'appreciation' through the recognition of the ecological and economic significance of rhino poaching.

Sentence: And there are fears that poaching gangs are infiltrating conservation organizations, too.
Analysis: The sentence "And there are fears that poaching gangs are infiltrating conservation organizations, too." expresses **'affect'** according to Martin's Appraisal Theory.

### Explanation:
- **Affect**: This category in Appraisal Theory deals with the expression of emotions and feelings. In this sentence, the emotion being expressed is "fears." The speaker is conveying a sense of anxiety or concern about the situation, which is a subjective emotional response.
- **Judgment**: This category involves the evaluation of behavior, particularly moral or social judgments. While the sentence does imply a negative assessment of poaching gangs and their actions, it does not explicitly judge the behavior of individuals or groups in a moral or social context.
- **Appreciation**: This category focuses on the evaluation of texts, objects, or phenomena in terms of their value or aesthetic qualities. The sentence does not evaluate the conservation organizations or the poaching gangs in terms of their value or aesthetic qualities; rather, it focuses on the emotional response to the situation.

Therefore, the primary appraisal expressed in this sentence is **'affect'** due to the emotional response of fear and concern.

Sentence: Ueda, who has volunteered on a South African nature reserve, said staff on the reserve were very cautious about sharing any rhino-related information with her.
Analysis: According to Martin's Appraisal Theory, the sentence can be analyzed as expressing 'judgment' and 'appreciation'.

1. **Judgment**:
   - The sentence expresses a form of 'judgment' through the evaluation of the behavior of the staff on the reserve. The phrase "very cautious about sharing any rhino-related information" implies a negative judgment on the part of the staff. This cautious behavior is being assessed as potentially unhelpful or restrictive, which falls under the category of 'social sanction' in Martin's Appraisal Theory. Specifically, it evaluates the staff's actions as possibly hindering the sharing of important information, which could be seen as a form of social misconduct or inefficiency.

2. **Appreciation**:
   - The sentence also involves 'appreciation' in the context of the environment and the situation. The mention of a "South African nature reserve" and "rhino-related information" situates the discussion within the domain of natural environments and conservation efforts. The appreciation here is not explicitly positive or negative but rather situates the context within a specific domain of value—that of environmental conservation and the management of sensitive information related to endangered species like rhinos.

In summary, the sentence expresses 'judgment' through the evaluation of the staff's behavior and 'appreciation' by situating the discussion within the context of environmental conservation and the management of sensitive information.

Sentence: "Some staff were more careful with me at the beginning of my assignment, or were not very willing to talk to me at all," she said.

   - **Analysis**: The sentence can be seen as expressing a form of judgment. The speaker evaluates the behavior of the staff in terms of their willingness to interact ("more careful" and "not very willing to talk"). This evaluation implies a judgment about the social behavior of the staff, suggesting that their actions were either positive (being careful) or negative (unwillingness to talk).

3. **Appreciation**:
   - **Definition**: Appreciation involves evaluating the value of things, processes, or situations.
   - **Analysis**: The sentence does not focus on evaluating the value of a thing, process, or situation. Instead, it evaluates the behavior of the staff. Therefore, 'appreciation' is not the primary focus here.

### Conclusion:

- **Intensity**: The phrase "make jokes about" suggests a mild form of judgment, as it implies that the behavior is inappropriate but not necessarily malicious or severe.

Overall, the sentence reflects a negative evaluation of the behavior of making jokes about poaching rhinos, which falls under the 'judgment' category in Appraisal Theory.

Sentence: For Ueda, the key lies in educating people back home about the damage their medicines are doing.
Analysis: The sentence expresses **'judgment'** according to Martin's Appraisal Theory.

### Explanation:
- **Judgment**: The sentence involves an evaluation of the actions of people back home, specifically their use of medicines. The phrase "the damage their medicines are doing" implies a negative assessment of their behavior, suggesting that it is harmful or detrimental. This aligns with the category of 'judgment' in Appraisal Theory, which deals with the evaluation of behavior, social esteem, and social sanction.
- **Affect**: The sentence does not primarily express emotions or feelings (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger). It is more focused on the evaluation of actions rather than emotional states.
- **Appreciation**: The sentence does not focus on the aesthetic, ethical, or natural value of something. Instead, it evaluates the consequences of actions, which falls under 'judgment' rather than 'appreciation'.

Therefore, the sentence primarily expresses 'judgment' as it evaluates the negative impact of people's actions regarding their use of medicines.

Sentence: "Buyer ignorance and indifference to wild animals is the first target for education," she said.

- **Affect**: While the sentence does touch on emotions (indifference can be seen as an emotional state), the primary focus is on the evaluation of behavior rather than the expression of emotions.

- **Appreciation**: The sentence does not primarily focus on the evaluation of a cultural or natural phenomenon, object, or process. Instead, it evaluates the behavior of buyers, making 'judgment' the more appropriate category.

In summary, the sentence primarily expresses a moral evaluation (judgment) of buyer behavior, specifically their ignorance and indifference to wild animals.

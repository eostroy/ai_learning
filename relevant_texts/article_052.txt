Pakistan to export meat, hides of 2 lakh donkeys to China every year
Pakistan plans to export donkey meat and hides to China by the end of this year, as the demand for these products grows in the neighbouring country.
Dr Ikram, an official from Pakistan's Ministry of National Food Security and Research, confirmed this development during an interview with Independent Urdu.
Dr Ikram stated, "The agreements with China are for the annual supply of 216,000 donkey hides and meat.
However, Chinese companies are showing interest in establishing slaughterhouses near Karachi Port."
He further explained that due to concerns over food security, slaughterhouses within the city will not be approved to prevent the local market from being impacted.
"We are prioritising the establishment of slaughterhouses outside Karachi, preferably near commercial ports," he added.
In July, during a briefing to the Senate Standing Committee on Commerce, the Secretary of Commerce noted that there is no ban on exporting donkeys, and Pakistan has already initiated donkey farming.
"We have finalised the agreement for donkey hides with China, while discussions on exporting donkey meat are ongoing," the secretary said.
Dr Ikram also revealed that new slaughterhouses are being built in Gwadar to facilitate these exports, ensuring that the local market remains unaffected.
The slaughterhouse, dedicated to this purpose, will have the capacity to process 216,000 donkeys annually.
Addressing concerns about donkey farming, Dr Ikram shared that Pakistan currently has a population of 5.2 million donkeys, according to a recent government census.
He acknowledged the need to maintain this population by encouraging local farms to engage in donkey breeding.
"We are working to have Chinese companies partner with local farms to provide breeding facilities, creating employment opportunities at the local level," he added.
According to Pakistani columnist Tahreem Azeem, who studied in China, donkey meat is a popular delicacy in China's Hebei province, where donkey meat burgers are considered a specialty.
"These restaurants proudly display images of donkeys on their exteriors, signalling the availability of donkey meat," she noted.
In addition to its culinary uses, donkey hides are also utilised in the production of traditional Chinese medicines.
Azeem explained, "Collagen derived from donkey hides is used in medicines, with one such popular product being Ejiao, which is believed to help improve blood circulation, combat insomnia, and treat dry cough."

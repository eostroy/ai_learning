Russia: Sino-Russian trade turnover steadily rising at key Amur River crossing point
Trade turnover between Russia and China along the cross-border bridge through the Kani-Kurgan - Heihe crossing point is gradually growing, the Russian Consulate-General in Harbin reported on Friday.
"The freight turnover through the Kani-Kurgan - Heihe crossing point is steadily increasing.
The automobile bridge across the Amur River connecting the Russian and Chinese segments of the border crossing was commissioned on June 10, 2022.
About 60,000 metric tons of various goods were already carried over it in five months," the Consulate-General wrote in its Telegram channel.
Chinese exports dominate the cargo turnover here, namely, tires, spare parts, equipment, light industry goods, and new vehicles, according to the diplomatic mission.
Russia delivers lumber, soybean oil and raw materials for traditional Chinese medicine via this border crossing.
Motor vehicle imports to Russia have been rapidly growing over the last three months, the diplomatic mission noted.

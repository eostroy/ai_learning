President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the International Forum on the 50th Anniversary of the Discovery of Artemisinin and on Building a Global Community of Health for All.
Xi Jinping pointed out, artemisinin is a specific anti-malaria drug first discovered and successfully extracted by China.
Since its discovery 50 years ago, it has enabled China to eradicate malaria.
At the same time, China has actively championed the application of artemisinin across the world in multiple ways such as providing drugs and technical assistance, building anti-malaria centers and training professionals.
Millions of lives around the world, especially in developing countries, have thus been saved.
This is an important contribution to the global prevention and treatment of malaria and to the protection of human health.
Xi Jinping stressed, China stands ready to work with the rest of the international community to engage in closer exchanges and cooperation in the public health sector, jointly tackle global threats and challenges, build a global community of health for all, and make greater contributions to the health of people all over the world.
World Malaria Day falls on April 25.
The International Forum on the 50th Anniversary of the Discovery of Artemisinin and on Building a Global Community of Health for All was held in Beijing on this occasion.
The forum, with the theme of "Strengthening international development cooperation on fighting malaria by artemisinin, jointly building a global community of health for all", was co-hosted by the China International Development Cooperation Agency, the National Health Commission, and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
